<h2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information</h2>
<p>Angband is basically a complex single player dungeon simulation. A player
creates a character, choosing from a variety of races and classes, and then
plays that character over a period of days, weeks, even months.</p>
<p>The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by buying from various shop
owners. Then the player can descend into the Pits of Angband, where he will
explore the many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing
fierce creatures, collecting powerful objects and valuable treasure, and
returning to town occasionally to buy and sell supplies. Eventually, as the
player grows more experienced, he may attempt to win the game by defeating
Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness, who resides far below the surface.</p>
<p>Note that Angband is a very complex game, and it may be difficult to grasp
everything at first, especially if you have never played a &quot;roguelike&quot; game
before. You should probably browse through all of the &quot;online help files&quot;,
especially this one, before beginning any serious adventuring...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-game">
<h2>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the game</h2>
<p>Angband has been maintained by a succession of volunteers since it was
written in the early 1990s. The most current maintainer is Nick McConnell.</p>
<p>Angband will run on a wide variety of systems (including Unix, Macintosh,
Windows). It is written in C, and the source code is freely available.
Creating a version for a new platform involves writing as few as 100 lines
of code and recompiling.</p>
<p>See the Official Angband Home Page at <a class="reference external" href="http://rephial.org/">http://rephial.org/</a> for up to date
information about the latest version of Angband, including a complete list
of recent modifications and a wiki about the game which includes a full
user guide.</p>
<p>You can post compliments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports, and patches
at <a class="reference external" href="http://angband.oook.cz">http://angband.oook.cz</a>, or to the newsgroup
'rec.games.roguelike.angband'. You can also post interesting experiences
and ask for help.</p>
<p>This version of Angband is under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL)
version 2. A copy of this licence is included with the game, in the file
copying.txt.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the development of the game, the public bug tracker
and development road map are at <a class="reference external" href="http://trac.rephial.org">http://trac.rephial.org</a>.</p>
<p>The basic help files supplied with this game are more or less up to date,
but when in doubt, you should ask the newsgroup or the forum for
confirmation.</p>
<p>Note that spoiler files are not distributed with the source since they may
spoil the game for new players (hence their name). If you want to use them,
you can obtain them from various places as with the source and executables.
Spoiler files may be placed into the &quot;lib/user/info&quot; directory, or into a user
specified external directory, to allow access via the &quot;online help&quot; system.</p>
<p>Remember to tell all your friends about how much you like Angband...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-quick-demonstration">
<h2>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick demonstration</h2>
<p>Angband is, as mentioned above, a very complex game, so you may want to try
the following quick demonstration. The following instructions are for
demonstration purposes only, and so they are intentionally boring.</p>
<p>For this demo, we will assume that you have never played Angband before,
that you have not requested any special &quot;sub-windows&quot;, that you have not
requested any special &quot;graphics&quot; modes, that you have a &quot;numeric keypad&quot; on
your computer, and that you are using the default options, including, in
particular, the &quot;original&quot; command set. If any of these assumptions are
incorrect, you will need to keep in mind that this demo may not work. There
are many ways to view this file while playing, in particular, you should be
able to view it using the &quot;online help&quot; built into the game.</p>
<p>Any time you see the '-more-' prompt, read the message and press space.
This takes precedence over any other instructions. At any other prompt, for
example, if you accidentally hit a key, you can normally &quot;cancel&quot; the
action in progress by pressing escape.</p>
<p>When the game starts up, depending on what platform you are using, you may
be taken directly to the character creation screen, or you may have to ask
to create a new character by using the File menu. In either case, you will
be shown the character information screen, and you will be given a series
of choices. For this demo, press 'a' three times to elect a &quot;human warrior&quot;
character with the point-based stat allocation system. You will now be
presented with a description of your character. Look over the
description briefly, there is a lot of information here, and most of it
will not make any sense. Press enter three times and your character will be
placed into the &quot;town&quot;.</p>
<p>You should now be looking at the basic dungeon interaction screen. To the
left is some information about your character. To the right is an overhead
view of the town. Nothing happens in Angband while the game is waiting for
you to specify a command, so take a good look at the town. You will see a
variety of symbols on the screen. Each symbol normally represents a terrain
feature, an object, or a monster. The '&#64;' symbol is special, it
represents your character. You can use the '/' command to find out what a
given symbol represents. Press &quot;/&quot; then '&#64;' now to verify the meaning of
the '&#64;' symbol.</p>
<p>The solid blocks (which may be '#' symbols on some systems) around the
edge of the town represent the walls that surround the the town. You cannot
leave the town above ground, although some games derived from Angband
(called &quot;variants&quot;) have an overground element.</p>
<p>The 3x3 squares represent stores. The &quot;numeric&quot; symbols represent an
&quot;entrance&quot; to a store. The '.' symbols represent the &quot;floor&quot;. It is
currently daytime, so most of the town should consist of stores and
illuminated floor grids.  There will also be a few ':' symbols which
represent &quot;passable rubble&quot;.</p>
<p>Any &quot;alphabetic&quot; symbols always represent monsters, where the word
&quot;monsters&quot; specifies a wide variety of entities, including people, animals,
plants, etc. Only a few &quot;races&quot; of monsters normally appear in town, and
most of them are harmless (avoid any mercenaries or veterans if you see
them). The most common &quot;monsters&quot; in town are small animals (cats and dogs)
and townspeople (merchants, mercenaries, miscreants, etc).</p>
<p>Now use the 'l' command to &quot;look&quot; around. This will cause the cursor to
be moved onto each &quot;interesting&quot; square, one at a time, giving you a
description of that square. The cursor always starts on the square
containing your character. In this case, you will see a message telling you
that your character is standing on a staircase. Keep pressing space until
the prompt goes away.</p>
<p>Now press 'i', to display your character's &quot;inventory&quot;. New characters
start out with some objects to help them survive (though there is an option
to start with more money instead). Your character will have some food, a
potion, some torches, and a scroll. Press 'e' to see what you are
wearing. You will find you are wearing armour on your body, wielding a
broad sword and lighting the way with a torch. You have many other
equipment slots but they are all currently empty.</p>
<p>Press 't' to take something off. Note that the equipment listing is
reduced to those objects which can actually be taken off. Press 'g' to
take off the armour, and then press 'e' again. Note that the armour is no
longer shown in the equipment. Press escape. Press 'w' to wield something
and observe that the inventory listing is reduced to those objects which
can actually be wielded or worn, press 'e' to put the armour back on.</p>
<p>Monsters can only move after you use a command which takes &quot;energy&quot; from
your character. So far, you have used the 'w' and 't' commands, which
take energy, and the 'e', 'i', 'l', and '/' commands, which are
&quot;free&quot; commands, and so do not take any energy. In general, the only
commands which take energy are the ones which require your character to
perform ome action in the world of the game, such as moving around,
attacking monsters, and interacting with objects.</p>
<p>If there were any monsters near your character while you were experimenting
with the 'w' and 't' commands, you may have seen them &quot;move&quot; or even
&quot;attack&quot; your character. Although unlikely, it is even possible that your
character has already been killed. This is the only way to lose the game.
So if you have already lost, simply exit the game and restart this demo.</p>
<p>One of the most important things that your character can do is move around.
Use the numeric keys on the keypad to make your character move around. The
'4', '6', '8', and '2' keys move your character west, east, north,
and south, and the '7', '9', '1' and '3' keys move your character
diagonally. When your character first moves, observe the '&gt;' symbol that
is left behind. This is the &quot;staircase&quot; that she was standing on earlier in
the demo - it is the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Attempting to stay away from monsters, try and move your character towards
the entrance to the &quot;general store&quot;, which is represented as a '1' on the
screen. As your character moves around, use the 'l' command to look
around. You can press escape at any time to cancel the looking. If you die,
start over.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things for people to get used to, when playing games of
this nature for the first time, is that the character is not the same as
the player. The player presses keys, and looks at a computer screen, while
the character performs complex actions, and interacts with a virtual world.
The player decides what the character should do, and tells her to do it,
and the character then performs the actions. These actions may induce some
changes in the virtual world. Some of these changes may be apparent to the
character, and information about the changes is then made available to the
player by a variety of methods, including messages, character state
changes, or visual changes to the screen. Some changes may only be apparent
to the player.</p>
<p>There are also a whole set of things that the player can do that can not
even be described in the virtual world inhabited by the character, such as
resize windows, read online help files, modify colormaps, or change
options. Some of these things may even affect the character in abstract
ways, for example, the player can request that from now on all monsters
know exactly where the character is at all times. Likewise, there are some
things that the character does on a regular basis that the player may not
even consider, such as digesting food, or searching for traps while walking
down a hallway.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, as you get used to the difference between the player
and the character, it becomes so &quot;obvious&quot; that you start to ignore it. At
that point, you find yourself merging the player and the character in your
mind, and you find yourself saying things like &quot;So yesterday, I was at my
friend's house, and I stayed up late playing Angband, and I was attacked by
some wild dogs, and I got killed by a demon, but I made it to the high
score list&quot;, in which the pronoun changes back and forth from the real
world to the virtual one several times in the same sentence. So, from this
point on you may have to separate the player and the character for
yourself.</p>
<p>So anyway, keep walking towards the entrance to the general store until you
actually walk into it. At this point, the screen should change to the store
interaction screen. You will see the name of the shop-keeper, and the name
of the shop, and a list of objects which are available. If there are more
than twelve different objects, you can use the space or arrow keys to
scroll the list of objects. The general store is the only tore with a fixed
inventory, although the amount of various items may vary. One of the items
sold here are flasks of oil. Press 'down' to highlight the line with
flasks of oil and press the 'p' key to purchase some. If you are asked
how many you want, just hit enter. Any time you are asked a question and
there is already something under the cursor, pressing return will accept
that choice. Hit enter to accept the price. Many commands work inside the
store, for example, use the 'i' command to ee your inventory, with the
new flask of oil. Note that your inventory is always kept sorted in a
semi-logical order, so the indexes of some of the objects may change as
your inventory changes.</p>
<p>Purchase a few more flasks of oil, if possible: this time, when asked how
many you want, press '3' then return to buy three flasks at once. Flasks
of oil are very important for low level characters, because not only can
they be used to fuel a lantern (when you find one), but also they can be
ignited and thrown at monsters from a distance. So it is often a good idea
to have a few extra flasks of oil. Press escape to leave the store. If you
want, take time to visit the rest of the stores. One of the buildings,
marked with an '8', is your &quot;home&quot;, and is not a real store. You can drop
things off at home and they will stay there until you return to pick them
up. The interface is exactly the same as a store, but there is no payment.</p>
<p>Now move to the staircase, represented by the '&gt;' symbol, and press
'&gt;', to go down the stairs. At this point, you are in the dungeon. Use
the 'l' command to look around. Note that you are standing on a staircase
leading back to town. Use the '&lt;' command to take the stairs back to
town. You may find that any townspeople that were here before have
disappeared and new ones have appeared instead. Now use the '&gt;' command
to go back down the stairs into the dungeon. You are now in a different
part of the dungeon than you were in before. The dungeon is so huge, once
you leave one part of the dungeon, you will never find it again.</p>
<p>Now look the screen. Your character may be in a lit room, represented as a
large rectangle of illuminated floor grids ('.'), surrounded by walls. If
you are not in a lit room, keep going back up to the town and back down
into the dungeon until you are. Now look around. You may see some closed
doors ('+') or some open doors (''') or some open exits ('.') in the
walls which surround the room. If you do not, keep playing the stairway
game until you are in such a room. This will keep the demo simple.</p>
<p>Now look around using the 'l' command. You may see some monsters and/or
some objects in the room with you. You may see some stairs up ('&lt;') or
some stairs down ('&gt;'). If you see any monsters, move up next to the
monster, using the movement keys, and then try and move into the monster.
This will cause you to attack the monster. Keep moving into the monster
until you kill the monster, or it runs away, or you die. If you die, start
a new game. If the monster runs away, ignore it, or chase it, but do not
leave the room. Once all the monsters in the room are dead or gone, walk on
top of any objects in the room. Press 'g' to get the object, and it will
be added to your inventory. If there are any closed doors ('+') in the
room walk up next to them and press 'o' and then the direction key which
would move you into the door, which should attempt to &quot;open&quot; the door.</p>
<p>Now use the movement keys to explore the dungeon. As you leave the room,
you will probably notice that your character cannot see nearly as far as
she could in the room. Also, you will notice that as she moves around, the
screen keeps displaying some of the grids that your character has seen.
Think of this as a kind of &quot;map&quot; superimposed on the world itself, the
player can see the entire map, but the character can only see those parts
of the world which are actually nearby. If the character gets near the edge
of the &quot;map&quot; portion of the screen the entire map will scroll to show a new
portion of the world. Only about ten percent of the dungeon level can be
seen by the player at one time, but you can use the 'L' command to look
at other pieces of the map. Use the '.' key, then a direction, to &quot;run&quot;
through the dungeon. Use the 'R' key, then return, to force your
character to &quot;rest&quot; until she has recovered from any damage she incurs
while attacking monsters. Use the 'M' key to see the entire dungeon level
at once, and hit escape when done. If your food rations are still at index
'a' in your inventory, press 'E', 'a' to eat some food. If your oil
is still at index 'b' in your inventory, and there is a monster nearby,
press 'v', 'b', ''' to throw a flask of oil at the nearest monster.
To drop an item from your inventory, press 'd' plus the index of that
item. You can use the '^X' key to quit and save the game.</p>
<p>You now know enough to play a quick game of Angband. There is a lot more
for you to learn, including how to interpret information about your
character, how to create different kinds of characters, how to determine
which equipment to wield/wear, how to use various kinds of objects, and how
to use the more than fifty different commands available to your character.
The best resource for learning these things is the online help, which
include, among other things, a complete list of all commands available to
you, and a list of all the symbols which you may encounter in the dungeon,
and information about creating new characters.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-character">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a Character</a></h1>
<p>Angband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of Angband. Perhaps the most important thing you
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be
chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your
character.</p>
<p>At the character creation screen you will be prompted to select the
race and class of your character. You also have the option to change the
'birth options' at this time. These need to be set at the character
creation menu and cannot be altered later in the game. They are discussed
with the rest of the options in the &quot;options&quot; help file.</p>
<div class="section" id="character-characteristics">
<h2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character Characteristics</h2>
<p>Each character has two primary attributes: race and class. These
are chosen at the beginning and which will stay fixed for the entire life
of that character. The race and class have many effects which are discussed
in detail below.</p>
<p>Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, and
background history. These are randomly determined according to the race of
the character, and are only used to provide flavour to the character to
assist in role playing.  There is an opportunity to edit background history
during character birth.</p>
<p>Each character also has five primary &quot;stats&quot;: strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, and constitution; they modify the abilities
of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher,
into the &quot;percentile&quot; range, represented as '18/01' through '18/100':
this is the maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat.
These stats can be modified further by equipment, race and class bonuses up
to a maximum of '18/220'.</p>
<p>Each character also has several primary &quot;skills&quot;: disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, searching frequency, fighting
skill, and shooting skill, which are derived from the character's race,
class, level, stats, and current equipment. These skills have rather
obvious effects, but will be described more completely below.</p>
<p>Each character may have one or more &quot;racially intrinsic skills&quot;, based on
the race of the character. These may include special resistances, or
abilities such as infravision.</p>
<p>Each character has a number of &quot;experience points&quot;, which increases as the
character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new items.
Characters also have a level, which is based on experience. The amount of
experience required to gain a new level is dependent on the character race
and class. Races and classes with more intrinsic benefits require more
experience to gain levels. As the experience rises, so does the level, and
as the level rises, certain other abilities and characteristics rise as
well. All characters start at 0 experience and at the first level.</p>
<p>Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it in the
dungeon. Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is
based on the character's social class (higher is better) and stats (less
powerful characters start with more gold). Each character also starts out
with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for
more gold.  However, especially valuable items will never sell for the full
price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that he is prepared to pay for any
item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy your items for up to 30,000
gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and will pay no more than 5,000.</p>
<p>Each character has an &quot;armour class&quot;, abbreviated to AC, representing how
well the character can avoid damage. The armour class is affected by
dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows and
being able to take blows without being hurt. Armour class on equipment is
always denoted in square brackets, usually as a figure of '[X,+Y]' where
X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is the magical bonus
to armour class provided by that item.</p>
<p>Each character has &quot;hit points&quot;, or hp, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before he dies. How many hit points a character has
is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: each race
has a basic &quot;hit dice&quot; number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is
11, while a hobbit's is 7. This is modified by class: for instance, a
warrior gets a +9 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets no bonus and a
priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's total hit die will be (11+9)=20 - meaning
that he gets between 1 and 20 hit points per level. If he were a priest,
his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 and 13 hit points per
level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-7 hps per level. (All characters
get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is a random roll of 1dX where
X is the hit die number, when the character goes up in level.) This is
further modified by constitution - a character with high constitution will
get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level (recalculated
right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, and you
are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)</p>
<p>Each character has spell points, or mana, which limits how many spells (or
prayers) a character can cast (or pray). The maximum number of spell points
is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom
(for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the maximum.
Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means. Warriors
never have any spell points. If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back
to first level, just as with constitution and hit points.</p>
<p>Lastly, each character has a base speed. Speed determines the amount of
&quot;energy&quot; your character acquires in the game, and therefore how often you
can take actions which use up energy (like moving or attacking). All
beginning characters move at normal speed and the only way to increase
speed is by magical means and equipment bonuses. Characters who are
carrying too much weight will move more slowly. Extra speed is one of the
most important boons in the game and therefore one of the rarest and most
sought after.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="races">
<h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Races</h2>
<p>There are eleven different races that you can choose to play in Angband.
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.
Most races also have intrinsic abilities.  The bonuses to statistics and
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move
to select one.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="human">
<dt>Human</dt>
<dd>The human is the base character.  All other races are compared to them.
Humans are average at everything and tend to go up levels faster than any
other race due to their shorter life spans.  No racial adjustments or
intrinsics occur to human characters.  Humans do not have any infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-elf">
<dt>Half-Elf</dt>
<dd>Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but not as wise or
strong. Half-elves are slightly better at magic, disarming, saving
throws, stealth, archery and searching, but they are not as good at
hand-to-hand combat. Half-elves are immune to dexterity draining, and
have weak infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="elf">
<dt>Elf</dt>
<dd>Elves are better magicians than humans, but not as good at fighting. They
tend to be smarter and faster than humans, though not as wise or strong.
Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, archery
and magic, but they are not as good at hand-to-hand combat. They are
resistant to attacks involving bright light, are immune to dexterity
draining, and have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="hobbit">
<dt>Hobbit</dt>
<dd>Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at shooting, throwing, and have good
saving throws. They also are very good at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer to
be called burglars. They will be much weaker than humans, and not good at
melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision. They have a strong hold
on their life force, and are thus resistant to life draining. Hobbits are
very partial to mushrooms and can identify them when found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="gnome">
<dt>Gnome</dt>
<dd>Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the
halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent
mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching,
disarming, perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans
so they are not very good at fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have good
infravision.  Gnomes are intrinsically protected against paralysis and
some   slowing effects. Gnomes are excellent at using wands and staves
and can identify them when found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="dwarf">
<dt>Dwarf</dt>
<dd>Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
or priest - or indeed, that combination of the two, the paladin. Dwarves
tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist
spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have excellent infravision.
They can never be blinded. Dwarves are excellent at digging, and can
sense nearby buried treasure. They have one big drawback, though. Dwarves
are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.
In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-orc">
<dt>Half-Orc</dt>
<dd>Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at
magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching,
disarming, and perception. Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly. They tend
to pay more for goods in town. Half-Orcs do make good warriors and
rogues, for the simple reason that Half-Orcs tend to have great
constitution and lots of hit points. Because of their preference to
living underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist darkness attacks.
They have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-troll">
<dt>Half-Troll</dt>
<dd>Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than any
other character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They will make
great warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in
their presence. Half-trolls always have their strength sustained, and
they regenerate quickly like other trolls. Unfortunately, this
regeneration also requires them to eat more food than other races. They
have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="dunadan">
<dt>Dunadan</dt>
<dd>Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race surpasses
human abilities in every field, especially constitution. However, being
men of the world, very little is new to them, and levels are very hard to
gain... their hardiness ensures that their constitution cannot be
reduced. They have no infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="high-elf">
<dt>High-Elf</dt>
<dd>High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and
answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before
the sun and moon were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for many
thousands of years before returning to mortal lands. Because of this,
they are far superior in terms of abilities when compared to their lesser
Elven kindred. They can also see into the invisible world of ghosts and
wraiths. However, they find new experience even harder to come by than
Dunedain. Like normal Elves, they resist attacks involving bright light.
They have good infravision and can even see cold-blooded invisible
creatures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="kobold">
<dt>Kobold</dt>
<dd>Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.
They have excellent infravision, and are intrinsically resistant to
poisons of all kinds. They have a good dexterity and constitution.
However, they are weaker than humans, and also not noted for great
intelligence. Furthermore, they are ugly, and not trusted in town. And
while their constitution makes them tough, it still cannot prevent the
fact that they are not the biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="classes">
<h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes</h2>
<p>Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class.  The class
is the character's occupation and determines stat bonuses, abilities,
hit dice, and what spells (if any) the character can learn.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="warrior">
<dt>Warrior</dt>
<dd>A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
a magical device. His prime stats are strength, constitution, and
dexterity, and he will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
cannot learn any spells.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="mage">
<dt>Mage</dt>
<dd>A Mage must live by his wits. He cannot hope to simply hack his way
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. He can
master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
has the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at him.
However, he is incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is his primary stat
and at high levels he can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
are his true realm and he will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
other classes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="priest">
<dt>Priest</dt>
<dd>A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
which spells they will learn. They are familiar with magical devices,
preferring to call them &quot;instruments of God&quot;, but are not as good as a
mage in their use. Priests have great saving throws, and make decent
fighters, but they are not as good at using sharp weapons (swords and
polearms) owing to the holy strictures about shedding blood, so they
are better off using blunt weapons such as maces. Wisdom is the priest's
primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without
a chance of failure. Priests have poor stealth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="rogue">
<dt>Rogue</dt>
<dd>A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his cunning, but is
capable of fighting his way out of a tight spot. He is the master of
traps and locks, no device being impossible for him to overcome. A rogue
has a high stealth allowing him to sneak around many creatures without
having to fight, or sneak up and get the first blow. A rogue's perception
is higher than any other class, and many times he will notice a trap or
secret door before having to search. A rogue is better than warriors or
paladins with magical devices, but still cannot rely on their performance.
Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the powerful offensive spells
mages can use, and there will always be a chance of failure even with the
simplest spells. A rogue's primary stats are dexterity and intelligence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="ranger">
<dt>Ranger</dt>
<dd>A Ranger is a warrior/mage and a very powerful class. He is a good
fighter, and the best of all the classes with missile weapons, especially
bows. The ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is
capable of learning all but the most powerful spells. Because a ranger is
really a dual class character, more experience is required for him to
advance. A ranger has good stealth, good perception, good searching, a
good saving throw, and is good with magical devices. His primary stats
are strength, intelligence and dexterity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="paladin">
<dt>Paladin</dt>
<dd>A Paladin is a warrior/priest. He is a very good fighter, second only to
the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. He receives
prayers at a slower pace then the priest, but can use all but the most
powerful prayers. Because a paladin is really a dual class character, it
requires more experience to advance him. A paladin lacks much in the way
of abilities. He is poor at stealth, perception, searching, and magical
devices. He has a decent saving throw due to his divine alliance. His
primary stats are strength and wisdom.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stats">
<h2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stats</h2>
<p>After race and class are selected, you will be able to decide what stat
levels your character will have, by allocating a finite number of
&quot;points&quot; between the six statistics.  These points can be allocated
by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the &quot;Stat
Rollers&quot; section).  Each race/class combination also has a recommended
default setting for these statistics.  Statistics can be permanently
raised by various potions in the dungeon up to 18/100.  They can also be
temporarily drained by some monster attacks.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Strength</dt>
<dd>Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee combat. A
high strength can improve your chances of hitting as well as the amount
of damage done with each hit. Characters with low strengths may receive
penalties. Strength raises the amount of weight you can carry before
being slowed. It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.
Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning of the game.</dd>
<dt>Intelligence</dt>
<dd>Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like spellcasters:
mages, rangers, and rogues. Intelligence will affect the number of spells
you may learn each level as well as the number of spell points you
receive. Intelligence is the most important stat for mages. A high
intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully casting a
spell. You cannot learn spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower. A good
intelligence can also help with using magic devices, picking locks, and
disarming traps.</dd>
<dt>Wisdom</dt>
<dd>The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a priest or
paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence affects spellcasting.
Again, high wisdom will increase the number of mana points you have and
increase the number of prayers you can learn each level, while improving
the chance that a prayer will be successful. A good wisdom increases your
saving throw, thereby improving your chances of resisting magical spells
cast upon you by monsters.</dd>
<dt>Dexterity</dt>
<dd>Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity may
allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons. Dexterity
also increases a character's chances of hitting with any weapon and of
dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if the character has a high enough
dexterity, thieves will never be successful in stealing from him.</dd>
<dt>Constitution</dt>
<dd>Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, and
to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a high
constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them faster
while resting. Constitution is less important in the beginning of the
game, but will be the most important stat at the end.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skills">
<h2>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills</h2>
<p>Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with
the level of the character.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Infravision</dt>
<dd>Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon
is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see walls and
objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any warm-blooded
creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works equally well with
or without a light source. However, some of Angband's creatures are
cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source.
All non-human races have innate infravision. Humans (including Dunedain)
cannot gain infravision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does
not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race and on
magical equipment.</dd>
<dt>Fighting</dt>
<dd>Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but if his
dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive more blows with
lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
opponent. This kill increases with the level of the character. Inspecting
a weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.</dd>
<dt>Shooting Ability</dt>
<dd>Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in this
skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this ability may
modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done,
and the ability to hit a creature. This skill increases with the level of
the character.</dd>
<dt>Saving Throws</dt>
<dd>A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a
spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include
spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty
potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, but then
most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to
even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability. It is possible to
get 100% saving throw, making you immune to many attacks.</dd>
<dt>Stealth</dt>
<dd>The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with good
stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow.
Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely,
allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is based upon race
and class, but can me magically enhanced.</dd>
<dt>Disarming</dt>
<dd>Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes
picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming or lock picking
will gain the character a small amount of experience. A trap must be
found before it can be disarmed. Dexterity and intelligence both modify
the ability to disarm, and this ability increases with the level of the
character.</dd>
<dt>Magical Devices</dt>
<dd>Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience and
knowledge. Spell users such as mages and priests are therefore much
better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill is
modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the character.</dd>
<dt>Searching Frequency (Perception)</dt>
<dd>Perception is the ability to notice something without actively seeking it
out. This skill is based entirely upon race and class, and will never
improve unless magically enhanced.</dd>
<dt>Searching Ability (Searching)</dt>
<dd>To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps, and traps on
chests. Rogues are the best at searching, but mages, rangers, and priests
are also good at it. This skill is based entirely upon race and class,
and will never improve unless magically enhanced.</dd>

<p>For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base
level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character's skills, add the race value to the
class value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the
character has.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.</p>

<div class="section" id="stat-rollers">
<h2>2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stat rollers</h2>
<p>There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Point-based</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The point-based method allows you to &quot;buy&quot; improvements to your basic
stats by &quot;spending&quot; points on them. You have a fixed number of points to
spend, and making small changes to a stat costs proportionally less than
making large changes. Any unspent points are converted into your starting
money that you can use to buy equipment at the start of the game.</p>
<p>On selecting this option, you will find that the points have already been
assigned to default recommended values. These represent an algorithm's
opinion for the ideal point spending. However, you are free to reallocate
them as you wish.</p>

keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself. For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk. The character name is used on the high
score list.</p>
<p>You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a Roman numeral at the end
of your character name (like &quot;Fred I&quot; or &quot;Pimplesnarg XVI&quot;), the game will
automatically increment the numeral each time you die (or win!).</p>

<p>After you have created your character, you will begin your Angband
adventure. Symbols appearing on your screen will represent the dungeon's
walls, floor, objects, features, and creatures lurking about. In order to
direct your character through his adventure, you will enter single
character commands (see 'commands.txt').</p>
<div class="section" id="symbols-on-your-map">
<h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbols On Your Map</h2>
<p>Symbols on your map can be broken down into three categories: Features of
the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps; Objects which can be
picked up such as treasure, weapons, magical devices, etc; and creatures
which may or may not move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your
character's well being.</p>
<p>Some symbols are used to represent more than one type of entity, and some
symbols are used to represent entities in more than one category. The &quot;&#64;&quot;
symbol (by default) is used to represent the character.</p>
<p>It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols and their meanings.
The &quot;slash&quot; command ('/') will identify any character appearing on your
map (see 'commands.txt').</p>
<p>Note that you can use a &quot;user pref file&quot; to change any of these symbols to
something you are more comfortable with.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-town-level">
<h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Level</h2>
<p>The town level is where you will begin your adventure. The town consists of
eight buildings (each with an entrance), some townspeople, and a wall which
surrounds the town. The first time you are in town it will be daytime, but
note that the sun rises and falls (rather instantly) as time passes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="townspeople">
<h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Townspeople</h2>
<p>The town contains many different kinds of people. There are the street
urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to
come out of the woodwork when excited. Blubbering idiots are a constant
annoyance, but not harmful. Public drunks wander about the town singing,
and are of no threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug. And finally, no town would be complete without a warm
of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for the fun
of it. (There are assumed to be other people in the town, but they are not
represented on the screen as they do not interact with the player in any
way.)</p>
<p>Most of the townspeople should be avoided by the largest possible distance
when you wander from store to store. Fights will break out, though, so be
prepared. Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no
experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="town-buildings">
<h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Buildings</h2>
<p>Your character will begin his adventure with some basic supplies, and some
extra gold with which to purchase more supplies at the town stores.</p>
<p>You may enter any open store to buy items of the appropriate type.  The price
that the shopkeeper requests is dependent on the price of the item.  By
default stores will not buy items from the player.  If you choose to play with
selling enabled, stores have a maximum value; they will not pay more than that
for any item, regardless of how much it is actually worth.</p>
<p>Once inside a store, you will see the name and race of the store owner, the
name of the store, the maximum amount of cash that the store owner will pay
for any one item, and the store inventory, listed along with the prices.</p>
<p>You will also see an (incomplete) list of available commands. Note that
many of the commands which work in the dungeon work in the stores as well,
but some do not, especially those which involve &quot;using&quot; objects.</p>
<p>Stores do not always have everything in stock. As the game progresses, they
may get new items so check from time to time. Stores restock after 10000
game turns have passed, but the inventory will never change while you are
in town, even if you save the game and return. You must be in the dungeon
for the store to restock. Also, if you sell them an item, it may get sold
to a customer while you are adventuring, so don't always expect to be able
to get back everything you have sold. If you have a lot of spare gold, you
can purchase every item in a store, which will induce the store owner to
bring out new stock, and perhaps even retire.</p>
<p>Store owners will not accept known harmful or useless items. If an object is
unidentified, they will (if selling is enabled) pay you some base price for
it.  Once they have bought it they will immediately identify the object.
If it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory. If it was a bad
bargain, they simply throw the item away. You can use this feature to learn
item flavors.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The General Store ('1')</dt>
<dd>The General Store sells foods, some clothing, torches, scrolls of phase
door, scrolls of word of recall, oil, shovels, picks, and spikes. All of
these items and some others can be sold back to the General store for
money. The general store restocks like every store, but the inventory
types never change.</dd>
<dt>The Armoury ('2')</dt>
<dd>The Armoury is where the town's armour is fashioned. All sorts of
protective gear may be bought and sold here. The deeper into the dungeon
you progress the more exotic the equipment you will find stocked in the
armoury. However, some armour types will never appear here unless you
sell them.</dd>
<dt>The Weaponsmith's Shop ('3')</dt>
<dd>The Weaponsmith's Shop is where the town's weapons are fashioned. Hand
and missile weapons may be purchased and sold here, along with arrows,
bolts, and shots. As with the armoury, not all weapon types will be
tocked here, unless they are sold to the shop by the player first.</dd>
<dt>The Temple ('4')</dt>
<dd>The Temple deals in basic potions and scrolls, some approved priestly
weapons, as well as prayer books.</dd>
<dt>The Alchemy shop ('5')</dt>
<dd>The Alchemy Shop deals in all types of potions and scrolls.</dd>
<dt>The Magic User's Shop ('6')</dt>
<dd>The Magic User's Shop deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
staves, as well as magic user books.</dd>
<dt>The Black Market ('7')</dt>
<dd>The Black Market will sell and buy anything at extortionate prices.
However it occasionally has <strong>very</strong> good items in it. With the exception
of artifacts, every item found in the dungeon may appear in the black
market.</dd>
<dt>Your Home ('8')</dt>
<dd>This is your house where you can store objects that you cannot carry on
your travels, or will need at a later date.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="within-the-dungeon">
<h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within The Dungeon</h2>
<p>Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light, armor, and
weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon. Move on top of the '&gt;' symbol
and use the &quot;Down&quot; command ('&gt;').</p>
<p>Your character will enter a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
arrive somewhere on the first level of the dungeon. Each level of the
dungeon is fifty feet high (thus dungeon level &quot;Lev 1&quot; is often called &quot;50
ft&quot;), and is divided into (large) rectangular regions (several times larger
than the screen) by permanent rock. Once you leave a level by a staircase,
you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same &quot;depth&quot; that you
can explore later. Monsters, of course, can use the stairs, and you may
eventually encounter them again, but they will not chase you up or down
stairs.</p>
<p>In the dungeon, there are many things to find, but your character must
survive many horrible and challenging encounters to find the treasure lying
about and take it safely back to the town to sell.</p>
<p>There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon. Permanent light
which has been magically placed within rooms, and a light source carried by
the player. If neither is present, the character will be unable to see.
This will affect searching, picking locks, disarming traps, reading
scrolls, casting spells, browsing books, etc. So be very careful not to run
out of light!</p>
<p>A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply his own light. A
torch or lamp burns fuel as it is used, and once it is out of fuel, it
stops supplying light. You will be warned as the light approaches this
point. You may use the &quot;Fuel&quot; command ('F') to refuel your lantern (with
flasks of oil), and it is a good idea to carry extra torches or flasks of
oil, as appropriate. There are rumours of objects of exceptional power
which glow with their own never-ending light.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-found-in-the-dungeon">
<h2>3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects Found In The Dungeon</h2>
<p>The mines are full of objects just waiting to be picked up and used. How
did they get there? Well, the main source for useful items are all the
foolish adventurers that proceeded into the dungeon before you. They get
killed, and the helpful creatures scatter the various treasure throughout
the dungeon.</p>
<p>Several objects may occupy a given floor location, which may or may not
also contain one creature. However, Doors, rubble, traps, and staircases
cannot coexist with items.  As below, any item may actually be a &quot;pile&quot;
of up to 40 identical items. With the right choice of &quot;options&quot;, you
may be able to &quot;stack&quot; several items in the same grid.</p>
<p>You pick up objects by moving on top of them. You can carry up to 23
different items in your backpack while wearing and wielding up to 12
others. Although you are limited to 23 different items, each item may
actually be a &quot;pile&quot; of up to 40 similar items. If you 't'ake off an
item, it will go into your backpack if there is room: if there is no room
in your backpack, it will drop onto the floor, so be careful when swapping
one wielded weapon or worn piece of armor for another when your pack is
full.</p>
<p>You are, however, limited in the total amount of weight that you can carry.
If you exceed this value, you become slower, making it easier for monsters
to chase you. Note that there is no upper bound on how much you can carry,
if you do not mind being slow. Your weight &quot;limit&quot; is determined by your
strength.</p>
<p>Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands for their use.
Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls must be Read, and potions
must be Quaffed. You may, in general, not only use items in your pack, but
also items on the ground, if you are standing on top of them. At the
beginning of the game all items are assigned a random 'flavor'. For example
potions of 'cure light wounds' could be 'red potions'. If you have never
used, sold, or bought one of these potions, you will only see the flavor.
You can learn what type of item it is by selling it to a store, using it
and noticing an effect (for example, quaffing a healing potion when
injured), or casting the spell identify. Lastly, items in stores that you
have not yet identified the flavor of will be labeled '{unknown}'</p>
<p>Chests are complex objects, containing traps, locks, and possibly treasure
or other objects inside them once they are opened. Many of the commands
that apply to traps or doors also apply to chests and, like traps and
doors, these commands do not work if you are carrying the chest.</p>
<p>One item in particular will be discussed here. The scroll of &quot;Word of
Recall&quot; can be found within the dungeon, or bought at the temple in town.
All classes start with one of these scrolls in their inventory. It acts in
two manners, depending upon your current location. If read within the
dungeon, it will teleport you back to town. If read in town, it will
teleport you back down to the deepest level of the dungeon which your
character has previously been on. This makes the scroll very useful for
getting back to the deeper levels of Angband. Once the scroll has been read
it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect it to save you in a
crisis. During this time the word 'recall' will appear on the bottom of the
screen below the dungeon. Reading a second scroll before the first takes
effect will cancel the action.</p>
<p>You may &quot;inscribe&quot; any object with a textual inscription of your choice.
These inscriptions are not limited in length, though you may not be able to
see the whole inscription on the item. The game applies special meaning to
inscriptions containing any text of the form '&#64;#' or '&#64;x#' or '!x' or
'!*', see 'customize.txt'.</p>
<p>The game provides some &quot;fake&quot; inscriptions to help you keep track of your
possessions. Wands and staves which are known to be empty will be inscribed
with '{empty}'. Objects which have been tried at least once but haven't
been identified yet will be inscribed with &quot;tried&quot;. In addition while
carrying or wielding weapons or armor you may learn qualities of these
items. '{average}' means that the item has no magical bonuses.
'{magical}' means that it has magical bonuses although these bonuses may
be negative. An item with negative bonuses is not necessarily cursed. An
'{ego}' item has special abilities. If the abilities are not obvious to
the wielder the item will get an '{excellent}' tag. If the item has
obvious abilities, such as an increase to a statistic it will be labeled
'{splendid}'. Lastly, if at any point you pick up an Artifact you will
learn its name immediately and it will be labeled '{special}'. However,
you may not be aware of all its powers. Note that these inscriptions are
fake, and cannot be removed.</p>
<p>Only weapons and armor will receive these pseudo-identifications. Wands,
taves, rods, scrolls, potions and mushrooms can only get the '{tried}'
label. However, if using or consuming the item creates an obvious effect,
you will learn the flavor.</p>
<p>It is rumored that rings of power and extra rare spell books may be found
deeper in the dungeon...</p>
<p>And lastly, a final warning: not all objects are what they seem. The line
between tasty food and a poisonous mushroom is a fine one, and sometimes a
chest full of treasure will grow teeth in its lid and bite your hand off...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cursed-objects">
<h2>3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed Objects</h2>
<p>There remain some special objects of great power that have been cursed.  If
you wield a cursed item, you will not be able to take it off.  All cursed
items will be automatically identified as cursed when you add them into
your inventory.  It is also possible to have your weapons or armor cursed
through magical means, and this can destroy even the strongest artifact and
leave you saddled with a useless piece of junk.  If you want or need to
remove a curse, scrolls of enchantment can be found in the dungeon that
have a chance of lifting all curses except for permanent ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mining">
<h2>3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mining</h2>
<p>Some treasure within the dungeon can be found only by mining it out of the
walls. Many rich strikes exist within each level, but must be found and
mined. Quartz veins are the richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but
magma veins will have some hoards hidden within.</p>
<p>Mining is rather difficult without a pick or shovel. Picks and shovels have
an additional magical ability expressed as '(+#)'. The higher the number,
the better the magical digging ability of the tool. A pick or shovel also
has plusses to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon, because, in
fact, it is one.</p>
<p>When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character may wield his pick
or shovel and begin digging out a section. When that section is removed, he
can locate another section of the vein and begin the process again. Since
granite rock is much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the
vein exactly and dig around the granite. Eventually, it becomes easier to
simply kill monsters and discover items in the dungeon to sell, than to
walk around digging for treasure. But, early on, mineral veins can be a
wonderful source of easy treasure.</p>
<p>If the character has a scroll, staff, or spell of treasure location, he can
immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein shown on the
screen. This makes mining much easier and more profitable.</p>
<p>Note that a character with high strength and/or a heavy weapon does not
need a shovel/pick to dig, but even the strongest character will benefit
from a pick if trying to dig through a granite wall.</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within the dungeon by
using various magical spells and items. So it can be a good idea to always
carry some kind of digging tool, even when you are not planning on
tunneling for treasure.</p>
<p>There are rumors of certain incredibly profitable rooms buried deep in the
dungeon and completely surrounded by permanent rock and granite walls,
requiring a digging implement or magical means to enter. The same rumors
imply that these rooms are guarded by incredibly powerful monsters, so
beware!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="traps">
<h2>3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traps</h2>
<p>There are many traps located in the dungeon of varying danger. These traps
are hidden from sight and are triggered only when your character walks over
them. If you have found a trap you can attempt to 'D'isarm it, but
failure may mean activating it.</p>
<p>There are some magical means to detecting all traps within a certain
radius. If you cast one of these spells, there will be a 'Dtrap' green
label on the bottom of the screen, below the dungeon map. At some point in
the dungeon you may see a line of green squares on the floor. This line
represents the extent of your detection. Beyond the green line you are no
longer in the afe region.</p>
<p>Some monsters have the ability to create new traps on the level that may be
hidden, even if the player is in a detected zone. The detection only finds
the traps that exist at the time of detection, it does not inform you of
new ones that have since been created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="staircases-secret-doors-passages-and-rooms">
<h2>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staircases, Secret Doors, Passages, and Rooms</h2>
<p>Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper or climb out of the
dungeon. The symbols for the up and down staircases are the same as the
commands to use them. A '&lt;' represents an up staircase and a '&gt;'
represents a down staircase. You must move your character over the
staircase before you can use it.</p>
<p>Each level has at least one up staircase and at least two down staircases.
There are no exceptions to this rule. You may have trouble finding some
well hidden secret doors, or you may have to dig through obstructions to
get to them, but you can always find the stairs if you look hard enough.
Stairs, like permanent rock, and shop entrances, cannot be destroyed by any
means.</p>
<p>Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and demoralize
adventurers foolish enough to enter. But with some luck, and lots of
concentration, you can find these secret doors. Secret doors will sometimes
hide rooms or corridors, or even entire sections of that level of the
dungeon. Sometimes they simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.
Secret doors always look like granite walls, just like traps always look
like normal floors.</p>
<p>Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use these secret doors,
and can often be counted on to leave them open behind them when they pass
through.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-and-object-feelings">
<h2>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level and object feelings</h2>
<p>Unless you have disabled the option to get feelings you will get a message
upon entering a dungeon giving you a general feel of how dungerous that
level is.</p>
<p>The possible messages are :
1 - &quot;This seems a quiet, peaceful place&quot;
2 - &quot;This seems a tame, sheltered place&quot;,
3 - &quot;This place seems reasonably safe&quot;,
4 - &quot;This place does not seem too risky&quot;,
5 - &quot;You feel nervous about this place&quot;,
6 - &quot;You feel anxious about this place&quot;,
7 - &quot;This place seems terribly dangerous&quot;,
8 - &quot;This place seems murderous&quot;,
9 - &quot;Omens of death haunt this place&quot;,
This feeling depends only on the monsters present in the dungeon when you
first enter it. It will not get reduced to safer feeling as you kill
monsters neither will it increase if new ones are summoned.
This feeling also depends on your current dungeon depth. A dungeon you
feel nervous about at 2000' is way more dangerous than a murderous one
at 50'.</p>
<p>Once you have explored a certain ammount of the dungeon you will also
get a feeling about how good are the objects lying on the floor of the
dungeon.</p>
<p>The possible messages are :
1 - &quot;there are naught but cobwebs here.&quot;
2 - &quot;there are only scraps of junk here.&quot;,
3 - &quot;there aren't many treasures here.&quot;,
4 - &quot;there may not be much interesting here.&quot;,
5 - &quot;there may be something worthwhile here.&quot;,
6 - &quot;there are good treasures here.&quot;,
7 - &quot;there are very good treasures here.&quot;,
8 - &quot;there are excellent treasures here.&quot;,
9 - &quot;there are superb treasures here.&quot;,
$ - &quot;you sense an item of wondrous power!&quot;,
The last message indicates an artifact is present and is only possible
if the preserve option is disabled.</p>
<p>You may review your level feeling any time by using the ^K command.
You may also consult it by checking the LF: indicator at the bottom
left of the screen. The first number after it is the level feeling
and the second one is the object feeling. The second one will be ?
if you need to explore more before getting a feeling about the value
of the treasures present in the dungeon.</p>

<p>If your character has killed Sauron (a difficult task), who lives on level
99 (4950') in the dungeon, a magical staircase will appear that will allow
you to finally reach level 100. Morgoth lurks on this level of his dungeon,
and you will not be able to go below his level until you have killed him.
Try to avoid wandering around on level 100 unless you are ready for him,
ince he has a habit of coming at you across the dungeon, the Mighty Hammer
'Grond' in hand, to slay you for your impudence.</p>
<p>If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER. You may continue to explore, and may even ave
the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest
creature alive, there is really not much point. Unless you wish to listen
to the rumors of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon, or a suit
of dragon scale mail that resists everything...</p>
<p>When you are ready to retire, simply &quot;commit suicide&quot; (using the 'Q' key)
to have your character entered into the high score list as a winner. Note
that until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire
before wandering into yet another horde of greater demons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upon-death-and-dying">
<h2>3.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Death and Dying</h2>
<p>If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died and cannot be
restored. A tombstone showing information about your character will be
displayed. You are also permitted to get a record of your character, and
all your equipment (identified) either on the screen or in a file.</p>
<p>Your character will leave behind a reduced save file, which contains only
the monster memory and your option choices. It may be restored, in which
case a new character is generated exactly as if the file was not there, but
the new player will find his monster memory containing all the experience
of past incarnations.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to &quot;cheat&quot; death (including using a special
&quot;cheating option&quot;) when it would otherwise occur. This will fully heal your
character, returning him to the town, and marking him in various ways as a
character which has cheated death. Cheating death, like using any of the
&quot;cheating options&quot;, will prevent your character from appearing on the high
score list.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacking monsters</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="attacking-and-being-attacked">
<h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacking and Being Attacked</h2>
<p>Attacking is simple in Angband. If you move into a creature, you attack it.
You can attack from a distance by firing a missile or by magical means
(such as aiming a wand). Creatures attack in the same way. If they move
into you, they attack you. Some creatures can also cast spells from a
distance, and others can use various breath weapons (such as fire) on you
from a distance.</p>
<p>Creatures in walls can not be attacked by wands or other magic attacks
normally stopped by walls, nor can they be shot at with bows and arrows.
Tunnelling into the wall (using the &quot;tunnel&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; command) will allow
you to attack any creature in the wall with your main weapon. This applies
to creatures which &quot;pass through&quot; walls: if they &quot;bore through&quot; walls, the
wall is no longer there, and the creature can be targetted normally.</p>
<p>If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is used when you
hit a creature. Otherwise you get a single punch which does minimal damage.</p>
<p>You may 'w'ield one weapon for melee combat, and also one missile
launcher (bow, crossbow or sling). You may also wear one amulet (around the
one and only neck of the character), two rings (on the two &quot;ring&quot; fingers,
i.e. the third finger of each hand: a magic ring does not function when
worn on any other finger, nor may two be worn on the same finger), one
light source, and a full set of armor - body armor, shield, helmet, gloves,
boots and a cloak. Any or all of these items may provide powers to the
character in terms of bonuses to-hit, to-damage, to-armor class, or to
other stats.</p>
<p>Firing a missile (while wielding the appropriate launcher) is the only way
to get the &quot;full&quot; power out of the missile. You may of course throw an
arrow at a monster without shooting it, but you will find the effects will
not be what you had hoped.</p>
<p>Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit versus armor class. A hit
is a strike that does some damage; a miss may in fact reach a target, but
fails to do any damage. Higher armor classes make it harder to do damage,
and so lead to more misses. Characters with higher armor classes also
receive a damage reduction. This is not true for monsters, whose AC only
affects the character's difficulty to hit them.</p>
<p>If you wish to see how much damage your weapon will do, you can
'I'nspect it. You will find the number of blows and how much damage you
would do per round, including information on whether your weapon damages
other types of monsters differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monster-memories">
<h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster Memories</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of different creatures in the pits of Angband, many of
which have the same letter symbol and color on the screen. The exact
species of a creature can be discovered by 'l'ooking at it. It is also
very difficult to keep track of the capabilities of various creatures.
Luckily, Angband automatically keeps track of your experiences with a
particular creature. This feature is called the monster memory. Your
monster memory recalls the particular attacks of each creature (whether or
not technically a monster) which you have suffered, as well as recalling if
you have observed them to multiply or move erratically, or drop treasure,
etc. Otherwise you would simply have to take notes, which is an unnecessary
bother.</p>
<p>If you have killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered enough
attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide you with information
not otherwise available, such as a armor class, hit dice, spell types,
frequency of spell casting, or the amount of damage for breaths or spells.
These attacks will be color coded to inform you of whether or not you
currently resist a specific attack. Red or orange means you do not resist
it, yellow means you partially resist it, and green means you resist it or
are immune. If you attack a monster with specific elemental attacks you will
learn if the monster resists that element or if they are immune. There are
other magical means to learn about monster's abilities that don't require
you to actually experience the attacks.</p>
<p>This memory can be passed on to a new character even after you die by means
of a re-used save file. (You must start the new character by opening the
existing save file of the dead character for this to happen: using the
&quot;start new character&quot; option will not give access to any monster memory.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-weapon">
<h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Weapon</h2>
<p>Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you no good. You must wield a
weapon before it can be used in a fight. A secondary weapon can be kept by
keeping it in the backpack, and switching it with the primary weapon when
needed. This is most often used when switching between a melee weapon and a
digging tool, or when carrying two weapons, each of which provides a rare
power that the character needs at two separate times.</p>
<p>Weapons have two main magical characteristics, their enchanted ability to
hit and their enchanted ability to do damage, expressed as '(+#,+#)'. A
normal weapon would be '(+0,+0)'. Many weapons in Angband have bonuses to
hit and/or do damage. A very few weapons are cursed, and have penalties
that diminish your hit and/or damage bonuses. Cursed weapons cannot be
unwielded until the curse is lifted.  Luckily, all cursed items will be
immediately shown as {cursed} when you pick them up.  Unluckily, it is
rumored that there exist some powerful magic that can cause your weapons
or armour to become cursed.  Magically identifying a weapon will inform
you of the magical bonuses and penalties.</p>
<p>Angband assumes that your youth in the rough environment near the dungeons
has taught you the relative merits of different weapons, and displays as
part of their description the damage dice which define their capabilities.
Any damage enchantment is added to the dice roll for that weapon. The dice
used for a given weapon is displayed as 'XdY'. The number 'X' indicates
how many dice to roll, and number 'Y' indicates how many sides they have.
A '2d6' weapon will thus give damage from 2 to 12, plus any damage bonus.
The weight of a weapon is also a consideration. Heavy weapons may hit
harder, but they are also harder to use. Depending on your strength,
dexterity, character class, and weapon weight, you may get attack more
quickly: high dexterity and strength and low weapon weight are the main
factors. Warriors may get up to a maximum of 6 attacks per round: mages and
priests are limited to only 4: other classes may get up to 5. Your attacks
per round with a weapon are displayed as a decimal, e.g. 2.3 or 3.4 etc.
The fractions take the form of unused energy which is carried over to your
next turn.</p>
<p>Missile weapons, such as bows, have their characteristics added to those of
the missile used, if the proper weapon/missile combination is used, and
then the launcher multiplier is applied to the total damage, making missile
weapons very powerful given the proper missiles, especially if they are
enchanted. Like weapons, 'I'nspecting ammunition will tell you how much
damage you will do with your current missile launcher.</p>
<p>Although you receive any magical bonuses an unidentified weapon may possess
when you wield it, those bonuses will not be immediately added to the
displayed values of to-hit and to-dam on your character sheet. In order to
learn these plusses you must use the weapon in combat or use magical means
of identification. The same applies for missiles and launchers.</p>
<p>Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities. These are called ego
weapons, and are feared by great and meek. An ego weapon must be wielded to
receive the benefit of its abilities. It should be noted that some of these
items are considerably more powerful than others, and generally the most
powerful items are the rarest. Some items will have an obvious effect,
like an increase in infravision, or extra strength. These effects will be
noticed as soon as you wield the item. Other effects, like most
resistances, will need to be learned. You can learn them by either
suffering an appropriate attack, or by using magical means of
identification.</p>
<p>Some of the more common ego weapons are described at the end of this file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-armor-class">
<h2>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Armor Class</h2>
<p>Your armor class (or AC) is a number that describes the amount and the
quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0 to
200, though exceptionally good armor can improve even on the latter figure.</p>
<p>The larger your armor class, the more protective it is. A negative armor
class would actually help get you hit. Armor protects you in three manners.
First, it makes you harder to be hit for damage. A hit for no damage counts
as a miss, and is described as a miss. Second, good armor will absorb
some of the damage that your character would have taken from normal
attacks. Third, acid damage is reduced by wearing body armor (but the
armor may be damaged instead). It is obvious that a high armor class is
vital for surviving the deeper levels of Angband.</p>
<p>Each piece of armour has a base armor value, which, like the damage from
weapons, is assumed known by the player, and a magic bonus, which will not
be displayed unless the armor has been identified or was bought in a store.</p>
<p>Armor class values are always displayed between a set of square brackets,
as '[#]' or '[#,+#]'. The first value is the base armor class of the
armor. The second number is the magical bonus of the item, which is only
displayed if known, and will always have a sign preceding the value. These
plusses can be determined by wielding the armor in combat and being hit.
Note that a few rings, amulets, and weapons also have the '[+#]'
notation, indicating that they provide an armor bonus. Many pieces of heavy
body armor will also have a '(-#)' (in normal brackets) before the
'[#,+#]', which indicates that the weight of the armor decreases your
chances of hitting monsters. This can range from nonexistent for very light
armor to '(-8)' for the heaviest armor!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="non-melee-attacks-and-resistances">
<h2>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-melee attacks and resistances</h2>
<p>The player may at some time gain access to non-melee attacks, and many
monsters also have them. Perhaps the most famous of this type of attack is
dragon breath, but monsters may also cast spells at the player, and vice
versa. This damage generally is not affected by armor class, and does not
need a hit roll to hit the player or monster being aimed at.</p>
<p>Some attacks are purely magical: attack spells which blind, confuse, slow,
care or paralyze the target. These attacks are resisted by monsters of
higher level (native to deeper dungeon depths) and characters with a high
saving throw - saving throws being dependent on class, level and wisdom.
There are also available resistances to fear, blindness, confusion and
stunning, and the power of &quot;free action&quot; prevents magical paralysis and
most slowing attacks (the player may still be paralyzed by being &quot;knocked
out&quot; in melee or by a stunning attack, but this is very rare and can be
prevented with protection from stunning.) There are monsters that can
cause status effects such as blindness, paralysis or confusion through
their melee attack.  Since this is a physical effect and not a mental one,
the player will not get a saving throw.  However, having resistance to
that effect will prevent the negative status in all cases. It should
also be noticed that most unique monsters automatically pass their saving
throws, and some monsters are naturally resistant to confusion, fear and
sleep. Some monsters may have spells that 'cause wounds' that can be
deadly if successful but do no damage if the saving throw is passed.</p>
<p>Some melee attacks by monsters may drain a stat, as can some traps: this is
prevented by having that stat sustained. Drained stats are temporary and
can be restored on gaining a new character level or consuming rare items
found in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Some monsters may cast spells that teleport the player character. There is
no saving throw, except to those that would actually teleport him up or
down one dungeon level. Having resistance to nexus will also prevent being
level-teleported, but will not help against normal teleportation spell
attacks. The player may teleport monsters in the same way, with a spell,
wand or rod. No monsters, even Morgoth himself, canresist this
teleportation.  Yet...</p>
<p>Other attacks are usually element-based, including the aforementioned
example of dragon breath. Many monsters can breathe various attacks or cast
bolt or ball spells, and the player may also have access to bolt and ball
spells (or breathe like a dragon, in some rare circumstances). The player,
and the monsters, may be resistant to these forms of attack: resistance is
handled in different ways for the player and the monster, and for different
attack forms.</p>
<p>Bolt spells will hit the first monster (or the player) in the line of fire:
ball spells and breaths may centre on a target which may be hiding behind
other targets. Ball spells and breath weapons affect an area: other
monsters caught in the blast take reduced damage depending on how close to
the centre of the blast they are. Breath weapons are proportional to a
fraction of the monster's current hit points, with a maximum cap on the
damage (which is higher for the most common of such attacks, owing to the
fact that the resistances are also easier to find). Bolt and ball spell
damage is calculated differently - often (but not always) relative to
character or monster level.</p>
<p>In the case of fire, cold, lightning, acid and poison, if the monster has
resistance to a player attack of this kind it will take almost no damage.
If the player has one or more permanent sources of resistance, he will take
1/3 of the damage he would normally take: if the player has a temporary
source of resistance (whether from potion, spell or item activation), this
will also reduce the damage to 1/3 of its normal level, allowing the
character to take only 1/9 damage if he has both permanent and temporary
resistance. Having more than one source of permanent resistance confers no
extra bonus, and using more than one source of temporary resistance
increases only the duration of the resistance: in both cases, either the
resistance is present or it is not. But one permanent resistance and one
temporary resistance are both effective simultaneously.</p>
<p>Elemental attacks also have a chance to damage wielded equipment or destroy
items in the character's inventory. Fire attacks destroy scrolls, staves,
magic books and arrows. Acid attacks destroy scrolls, staves, arrows, bolts
and can damage armor. Electricity attacks can destroy wands, rods, rings
and amulets. Cold attacks can destroy potions. Items in your inventory get
a saving throw, and they are unharmed if they pass it. Having resistance to
the element will make an item less likely to be destroyed. Items on the
floor that get caught in an elemental ball or breath are automatically
destroyed without a saving throw. Weapons, armor and chests can also be
destroyed if they are lying on the floor, but cannot be harmed if they are
in your pack.</p>
<p>The character may also gain immunity to fire, cold, lightning and acid if
he is fortunate to find any of the few artifacts that provide these
immunities: immunity means that no damage is taken, and the character's
equipment is also totally protected. Immunities are EXTREMELY rare.</p>
<p>Another attack that the player will come into contact with all too often is
the soul-chilling nature of the undead, which can drain the character's
life experience. Some monsters have a life-draining melee attack, others
may cast ball or bolt spells or, in extreme cases, breathe the very force
of the netherworld (shortened by the game to &quot;nether&quot;.) There are two
powers which are of assistance in this case: that of &quot;hold life&quot; will
prevent 90% of all experience drains, and in the other 10% of cases, the
amount of experience lost will be reduced by 90%. That of &quot;resistance to
nether forces&quot; will provide resistance to nether bolts, balls and breaths,
reducing the damage and preventing any experience drains from these
attacks, but has no effect on melee &quot;hits to drain experience&quot;. Monsters
caught in the blast from a nether ball or breath will take damage
proportional to distance from the centre of the attack, except for undead
who are totally immune. The player may find wands or rods of Drain Life,
which similarly are ineffective on those undead creatures which have no
life to drain: however, the real player equivalent attack spell is the
priest/paladin spell of &quot;Orb of Draining&quot;, a ball spell which does damage
to all monsters, double damage to evil monsters, and is resisted by none.</p>
<p>Other attack forms are rarer, but may include: disenchantment (both in
melee or by a monster breath), chaos (breath or melee, which if unresisted
will cause the player to hallucinate and be confused, and may drain life
experience), nexus (which may teleport the player to the monster, away from
the monster, up or down a level, or swap over two of the player's
&quot;internal&quot; stats), light and darkness (which will blind a character unless
they have protection from blindness or resistance to light or dark), sound
(which will stun a character without sound resistance or protection from
stunning), crystal shards (which will cut a non-resistant character),
inertia (which will slow a character even if he has free action), gravity
(which will blink a character, also stunning and slowing), force (which
will stun the character), plasma and force (which will stun), time (which
may drain experience regardless of hold life, or drain stats regardless of
sustains), water bolts and balls (which may confuse and stun, and do
considerable damage from high-level monsters), ice bolts (which may
cut and stun, and damage potions), and mana bolts and balls (the latter
usually known as Mana Storms.) Magic missiles are included in the &quot;mana&quot;
category, whether cast by the monster or the player.</p>
<p>In addition items on the ground are especially vulnerable to elemental
effects.  Potions on the ground will always be destroyed by cold, shards,
sound and force.  Scrolls, staves, books, and non-metal gear will always get
destroyed by fire or plasma.  Scrolls, staves, and all non-mithril gear
will be destroyed by acid.  Rings, amulets, wands and rods will be
destroyed by lightning and plasma.  And finally nearly everything will be
destroyed by a mana storm if left on the ground.</p>
<p>Some attacks may stun or cut the player. These can either be spells or
breath attacks (sound, water balls) or from melee. A stunned character
receives a penalty to hit and is much more likely to fail a spell or
activation. If a character gets very stunned, they may be knocked out and
at the mercy of the enemies. A cut character will slowly lose life until
healed either by potions, spells or natural regeneration. Both stunning and
cut status are displayed at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>There are resistances available to chaos, disenchantment, confusion, nexus,
sound, shards, light and darkness: all of these will reduce the damage and
prevent side-effects other than physical damage. With these resistances, as
with nether resistance, damage is a random fraction: for light and dark, it
is between 4/7 and 4/12, for sound and confusion it is between 5/7 and
5/12, and for chaos, disenchantment, nexus, shards and nether it is between
6/7 and 6/12.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all of these are actually vital to completing
the game: indeed, of the above list, only fire, cold, acid, lightning,
poison and confusion resists are regarded as truly vital, with blindness,
chaos and nether the next most desirable. Some attack forms are not
resistable, but thankfully these are rare: resist shards will prevent all
other magical attacks which cut (namely ice bolts), and confusion resistance
will prevent confusion by a water bolt or ball, but there is no resistance
to the physical damage caused by these following attacks: inertia, force,
gravity, plasma, time, ice, water, mana. There is no resistance to any of
the side-effects of a time attack, or indeed to anything but the stunning
effects of a gravity attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-on-speed">
<h2>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A note on speed</h2>
<p>Monsters which do not move at normal speed generally move &quot;slowly&quot; (-10 to
speed), &quot;fast&quot; (+10), &quot;very fast&quot; (+20) or &quot;incredibly fast&quot; (+30). (It will
surprise nobody that Morgoth is one of the few monsters in the last
category.) This is further adjusted by the fact that any non-unique monster
may have a random adjustment from (-2) to (+2) to its own speed.</p>
<p>Generally, (+10) is exactly double normal speed, and (-10) exactly half.
(+20) is about three times normal speed, but after that there is less
noticeable improvement as speed goes higher - for instance, (+30) is not
quite four times normal speed, and higher values than this are largely
irrelevant. The player may find items which can be worn or wielded that
provide speed bonuses: these may include boots of speed, rings of speed and
a few very rare artifacts. Boots will provide a random 1d10 to speed: rings
of speed may be bigger than that - generally the best that the player will
get is two just over (+10), but individual rings of up to (+23) speed have
been known.</p>
<p>Separate from the question of permanent speed (as determined by the
player's speed items and the monster's natural speed) is that of temporary
speed. The player may cast a spell of haste-self, or use a potion, staff or
rod of speed or use an artifact activation to speed him temporarily: or a
monster may cast a haste-self spell, or be affected by another monster
&quot;shrieking for help&quot; or the player reading a scroll of aggravate monster.
In all cases, (+10) speed is added temporarily to the affected monster or
player. Using two or more sources of temporary speed is cumulative only in
duration - one cannot get from normal speed to (+20) using a potion and a
spell of speed. Spells of temporary slowing (including monsters breathing
inertia or gravity) are handled the same way, with exactly (-10) being
subtracted from the player or monster's speed temporarily, for the duration
of the spell or breath's effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ego-weapons-and-armor">
<h2>4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego weapons and armor</h2>
<p>Some of the ego weapons that you might find in the dungeon are listed
below. This will give you a small taste of the items that can be found.
However if you wish to discover these items on your own, you may not wish
to continue. Ego weapons are denoted by the following &quot;names&quot;:</p>
<div class="section" id="ego-melee-weapons">
<h3>4.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego Melee Weapons:</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>(Defender)</dt>
<dd>A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder defend himself, thus
increasing his/her armor class, and protecting him/her against damage
from fire, cold, acid, lightning, and falls. This weapon also will
increase your stealth, let you see invisible creatures, protect you from
paralyzation and some slowing attacks, and help you regenerate hit points
and mana faster. As a result of the regeneration ability, you will use up
food somewhat faster than normal while wielding such a weapon. These
powerful weapons also will sustain one stat, though this stat will vary
from weapon to weapon.</dd>
<dt>(Holy Avenger)</dt>
<dd>A Holy Avenger is often one of the most powerful weapons. A Holy Avenger
will increase your wisdom and your armour class. This weapon will do
extra damage when used against evil, demonic and undead creatures, and
will also give you the ability to see invisible creatures. These weapons
are basically extremely powerful versions of Blessed Blades and can be
wielded by priests with no penalty. These weapons, like (Defender)
weapons, also will sustain one random stat.</dd>
<dt>(Blessed)</dt>
<dd>A blessed blade will increase your wisdom. If you are a priest, wielding
a non-blessed sword or polearm causes a small penalty while attacking and
may infuriate your god, decreasing the chances that he will accept your
prayers: a blessed blade may be wielded without this penalty. Blessed
blades also have one extra, random, power.</dd>
<dt>Weapon of Westernesse</dt>
<dd>A Weapon of Westernesse is one of the more powerful weapons. It does
extra damage against orcs, trolls, and giants, while increasing your
strength, dexterity, and constitution. It also lets you see invisible
creatures and protects from paralyzation and some slowing attacks. These
blades were made by the Dunedain.</dd>
<dt>Weapon of Extra Attacks</dt>
<dd>A weapon of extra attacks will allow the wielder to deliver extra attacks
during each round.</dd>
<dt>Elemental Branded Weapons</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Each of the five elemental attacks has a corresponding weapon which will
do treble its base damage to creatures not resistant to that element. (It
should be noted that the magical damage bonus is not affected by this: a
weapon of Flame '(2d6) (+5,+6)' does 6d6+6 damage per hit, not 6d6+18,</p>
<p>against creatures which are not fire-resistant.) There are weapons of</p>
<p class="last">Flame, Frost, Lightning, Acid and Poison brands.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Weapons of Slaying enemies</dt>
<dd>These weapons do extra damage against creatures of a vulnerable type.
Weapons of Slay Evil and Slay Animal do double the base damage, while
weapons of Slay Orc, Troll, Giant, Dragon, Demon and Undead do triple the
base damage. As with elemental branded weapons, the magical damage bonus
is not affected.</dd>
<dt>Weapons of *Slay*ing enemies</dt>
<dd>These weapons, in addition to doing extra damage to your enemies, have
extra powers as well. In each case, one stat is increased. Weapons of
*Slay* Dragon, Demon or Undead are also more powerful against their
opponents, doing five times their base damage rather than the normal
three.</dd>
<dt>Shovels and Picks of Digging</dt>
<dd>These powerful diggers will dig through granite as if it were mere wood,
and mineral veins as if they were butter. Permanent rock is still an
impassable obstacle.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ego-missile-launchers-and-ammo">
<h3>4.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego Missile Launchers and Ammo:</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Launchers of Accuracy</dt>
<dd>These launchers have an unnaturally high to-hit number, making them
extremely accurate.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Velocity</dt>
<dd>These launchers do an unnaturally high amount of damage due to their high
to-dam number.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Extra Shots</dt>
<dd>These launchers allow the wielder to shoot more times per round than
normal.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Extra Might</dt>
<dd>These launchers have a higher base damage than normally made launchers of
their type. For instance, a 'Long Bow of Extra Might (x3)(+X,+Y)(+1)'
is really a Long Bow '(x4)(+X,+Y)' where '(+X,+Y)' is the standard
to-hit and to-dam. As the damage multiplier with the bow affects
<strong>everything</strong> the base arrow damage, the magical damage bonus on both
the bow and the arrow, and any bonuses for slaying or elemental-branded
arrows - this makes it a powerful weapon.</dd>
<dt>Ammo of Wounding</dt>
<dd>This ammunition - whether it be pebbles, iron shots, arrows, bolts,
seeker arrows or seeker bolts - has big bonuses to-hit and to-damage.</dd>
<dt>Ammo of Elemental Brands, and Ammo of Slaying enemies</dt>
<dd>This works in the same way as melee weapons of the same type: double
damage for slay evil and slay animal, triple damage for all other lays
and for all elemental brands. Unlike melee weapons, the slays and
elemental brands <strong>do</strong> affect the magical damage bonus for ammo.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are the most common types of ego-weapon: note that they are not the
ONLY ego-items available in the dungeon, there may be more.</p>
<p>Apart from these there are some very rare and well made weapons in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Blades
of Chaos, Maces of Disruption, and Scythes of Slicing.  They can also be
ego weapons like the ones above.  For example, a Blade of Chaos (Holy
Avenger) is much more powerful than many artifact weapons!</p>
<p>Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities denoted by the following
names:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ego-armors-and-shields">
<h3>4.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego Armors and Shields:</h3>

<dt>of Resist Acid, Lightning, Fire or Cold</dt>
<dd>A character wearing armor or a shield with one such resistance will take
only 1/3 of normal damage from attacks involving the relevant element of
acid, lightning, fire or cold. Note that multiple permanent sources of
resistance are NOT cumulative: wearing two is no better than wearing one.
However, armor which provides resistance to acid cannot itself be damaged
by acid, and this is a good reason to wear more than one such piece of
armor.</dd>
<dt>of Resistance</dt>
<dd>A character wearing armor with this ability will have resistance to Acid,
Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in each part above.</dd>
<dt>Armor of Elvenkind</dt>
<dd>This is the same as Resistance armor, only generally better enchanted. It
will make you more stealthy. This armor also possesses an extra
resistance, at random from the following list: poison, light, dark,
nexus, nether, chaos, disenchantment, sound, and shards.</dd>
<dt>Robes of Permanence</dt>
<dd>These robes are designed especially for wizards. Just like Elvenkind
armor, they provide resistance to fire, cold, acid, and electricity and
cannot be damaged by acid. They sustain all of your stats and protect you
from a good deal of all experience draining. Also like Elvenkind armor,
they have one random resistance.</dd>
<dt>Dragon Scale Mails</dt>
<dd>These extremely rare pieces of armour come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons. Naturally they are all
resistant to acid damage. They also occasionally allow you to breathe as
a dragon would.  Dragon Scale Mails can also have egos as well.</dd>

<dt>Stat Boosting Helms</dt>
<dd>There are magical helms found in the dungeon that have the ability to
boost the wearer's intelligence or wisdom. In addition to boosting the
relevant stat these helms will also prevent that stat from being drained.</dd>
<dt>Crown of the Magi</dt>
<dd>This is the great crown of the wizards. The wearer will have an increased
(and sustained) intelligence, and will also be given resistance against
fire, frost, acid, and lightning. These valuable helms also have an
additional random power.</dd>
<dt>Crown of Might</dt>
<dd>This is the crown of the warriors. The wearer will have an increased and
sustained strength, dexterity, and constitution, and will also be immune
to any foe's attempt to slow or paralyze him or her.</dd>
<dt>Crown of Lordliness</dt>
<dd>This is the great crown of the priests. The wearer will have an increased
and sustained wisdom.</dd>
<dt>Helm/Crown of Seeing</dt>
<dd>This is the great helmet or crown of the rogues. The wearer will be able
to see invisible creatures, and will have an increased ability to locate
traps and secret doors. It is also rumored that the wearer of such a helm
will not be able to be blinded.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Infravision</dt>
<dd>This helmet allows the character to see monsters even in total darkness,
with the ability to see heat. Note that spellbooks are the same
temperature as the surroundings, and so cannot be read unless some real
light is present. (Some monsters which are invisible to normal vision can
be seen under infravision.)</dd>
<dt>Helm of Light</dt>
<dd>In addition to providing a permanent light source for the wearer, this
helm also provides resistance against light-based attacks.</dd>
<dt>Helm/Crown of Telepathy</dt>
<dd>This helm or crown grants the wearer the power of telepathy.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Regeneration</dt>
<dd>This helm will help you regenerate hit points and mana more quickly than
normal, allowing you to fight longer before needing to rest. You will use
food faster than normal while wearing this helm because of the
regenerative effects.</dd>

<p>Once again, these are not necessarily the ONLY ego-items in the dungeon,
only the most common.</p>
<p>Apart from these there are some very rare and well-made armours in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Shields
of Deflection, Adamantite Plate Mail, Mithril Plate Mail, Mithril Chain
Mail, and Elven Cloaks. The first four cannot be damaged by acid because of
the quality metals they contain.</p>
<p>There are rumors of unique &quot;artifact&quot; items in the dungeon - weapons and
armor of all types. Many of these are more powerful than even the greatest
ego-items: some are weak and have little more than a name to recommend

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing the Game</a></h1>
<p>Most of your interaction with Angband will take the form of &quot;commands&quot;.
Every Angband command consists of an &quot;underlying command&quot; plus a variety of
optional or required arguments, such as a repeat count, a direction, or the
index of an inventory object. Commands are normally specified by typing a
series of keypresses, from which the underlying command is extracted, along
with any encoded arguments. You may choose how the standard &quot;keyboard keys&quot;
are mapped to the &quot;underlying commands&quot; by choosing one of the two standard
&quot;keysets&quot;, the &quot;original&quot; keyset or the &quot;roguelike&quot; keyset.</p>
<p>The original keyset is very similar to the &quot;underlying&quot; command set, with a
few additions (such as the ability to use the numeric &quot;directions&quot; to
&quot;walk&quot; or the '5' key to &quot;stay still&quot;). The roguelike keyset provides
similar additions, and also allows the use of the
'h'/'j'/'k'/'l'/'y'/'u'/'b'/'n' keys to &quot;walk&quot; (or, in
combination with the shift or control keys, to run or alter), which thus
requires a variety of key mappings to allow access to the underlying
commands used for walking/running/altering. In particular, the &quot;roguelike&quot;
keyset includes many more &quot;capital&quot; and &quot;control&quot; keys, as shown below.</p>
<p>Note that any keys that are not required for access to the underlying
command set may be used by the user to extend the &quot;keyset&quot; which is being
used, by defining new &quot;keymaps&quot;. To avoid the use of any &quot;keymaps&quot;, press
backslash ('\') plus the &quot;underlying command&quot; key. You may enter
&quot;control-keys&quot; as a caret ('^') plus the key (so '^' + 'p' yields
'^p').</p>
<p>Some commands allow an optional &quot;repeat count&quot;, which allows you to tell
the game that you wish to do the command multiple times, unless you press a
key or are otherwise disturbed. To enter a &quot;repeat count&quot;, type '0',
followed by the numerical count, followed by the command. You must type
'space' before entering certain commands. Skipping the numerical count
yields a count of 99. An option allows certain commands (open, disarm,
alter, etc) to auto-repeat.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction, an
inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the symbol of
a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of time, a
quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you can hit return
to choose the &quot;default&quot; response, or escape to cancel the command entirely.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for a spell or an inventory item. Pressing pace
(or '*') will give you a list of choices. Pressing '-' (minus) selects
the item on the floor. Pressing a lowercase letter selects the given item.
Pressing a capital letter selects the given item after verification.
Pressing a numeric digit '#' selects the first item (if any) whose
inscription contains '&#64;#' or '&#64;x#', where 'x' is the current
&quot;underlying command&quot;. You may only specify items which are &quot;legal&quot; for the
command. Whenever an item inscription contains '!*' or '!x' (with 'x'
as above) you must verify its selection.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a &quot;compass&quot;
direction using any of the &quot;direction keys&quot; shown below. Sometimes, you may
specify that you wish to use the current &quot;target&quot;, by pressing 't' or
'5', or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing '*' (see
&quot;Target&quot; below).</p>

<p>Each of the standard keysets provides some short-cuts over the &quot;underlying
commands&quot;. For example, both keysets allow you to &quot;walk&quot; by simply pressing
an &quot;original&quot; direction key (or a &quot;roguelike&quot; direction key if you are
using the roguelike keyset), instead of using the &quot;walk&quot; command plus a
direction. The roguelike keyset allows you to &quot;run&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; by simply
holding the shift or control modifier key down while pressing a &quot;roguelike&quot;
direction key, instead of using the &quot;run&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; command plus a
direction. Both keysets allow the use of the '5' key to &quot;stand still&quot;,
which is most convenient when using the original keyset.</p>

<div class="section" id="special-keys">
<h2>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Keys</h2>
<p>Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.</p>
<p>If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then 'Ctrl-C' will
interrupt Angband. The second and third interrupt will induce a warning
bell, and the fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message,
ince the fifth will quit the game, after killing your character. Also,
'Ctrl-Z' will suspend the game, and return you to the original command
shell, until you resume the game with the 'fg' command. There is now a
compilation option to force the game to prevent the &quot;double 'ctrl-z'
escape death trick&quot;. The 'Ctrl-\' and 'Ctrl-D' and 'Ctrl-S' keys
should not be intercepted.</p>
<p>It is often possible to specify &quot;control-keys&quot; without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.</p>
<p>Pressing backslash ('\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an &quot;underlying command&quot; key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. The backslash key is useful for creating actions which are
not affected by any keymap definitions that may be in force, for example,
the sequence '\' + '.' + '6' will always mean &quot;run east&quot;, even if the
'.' key has been mapped to a different underlying command.</p>
<p>The '0' and '^' and '\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no &quot;useful&quot; way to specify any of them as
an &quot;underlying command&quot;, which is okay, since they would have no effect.</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character 'ESCAPE' will
abort the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or
'n', or 'escape'. The '-more-' message prompts may be cleared (after
reading the displayed message) by pressing 'ESCAPE', 'SPACE',
'RETURN', 'LINEFEED', or by any keypress, if the 'quick_messages'
option is turned on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-counts">
<h2>5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Counts</h2>
<p>Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them
with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until
you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as
being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another
creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to
be repeated will flash by on the line at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>To give a count to a command, type 0, the repeat count, and then the
command. If you want to give a movement command and you are using the
original command set (where the movement commands are digits), press space
after the count and you will be prompted for the command.</p>
<p>Counted commands are very useful for time consuming commands, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also
terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any
character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a 'SPACE'
or 'ESCAPE' which are always ignored as commands in case you type the
command just after the count expires.</p>
<p>You can tell Angband to automatically use a repeat count of 99 with
commands you normally want to repeat (open, disarm, tunnel, bash, alter,
etc) by setting the 'always_repeat' option.</p>

<p>Many commands will also prompt for a particular object to be used.
For example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the
scrolls that you are carrying that you wish to read.  In such cases, the
selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet (or a number if choosing
from the quiver).  The prompt will indicate the possible letters/numbers,
and you will also be shown a list of the appropriate items.  Often you will
be able to press '/' to switch between inventory and equipment, or '|' to
select the quiver, or '-' to select the floor.  Using the right arrow also
rotates selection between equipment, inventory, quiver, floor and back to
equipment; the left arrow rotates in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case
letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately. If
upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you are
given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper case
selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke.</p>
<p>For more information on selecting object, see the file 'customize.txt'.</p>

<div class="section" id="command-descriptions">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Descriptions</a></h1>
<p>The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus the
default key to use it. For those who prefer the original &quot;roguelike&quot;
keyset, the name and key of the roguelike command is also shown if it is
different. Then comes a brief description of the command, including
information about alternative methods of specifying the command in each
keyset, when needed.</p>
<p>Some commands use the &quot;repeat count&quot; to automatically repeat the command
several times, while others use the &quot;repeat count&quot; to specify a &quot;quantity&quot;
for the command, and still others use it as an &quot;argument&quot; of some kind.</p>
<p>Most commands take no &quot;energy&quot; to perform, while other commands only take
energy when they cause the world to change in some way. For example,
attempting to read a scroll while blind does not use any energy.</p>
<p>The following command is very useful for beginners,</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Command lists ('Enter')</dt>
<dd>This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which you
can select what command you would like to use by browsing.  If you wish
to begin playing immediately, you can use this option to navigate the
commands and refer to this guide when you need more details about
specific commands.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="inventory-commands">
<h2>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inventory list ('i')</dt>
<dd>Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You can carry
up to 23 different items, not counting those in your equipment. Often,
many identical objects can be &quot;stacked&quot; into a &quot;pile&quot; which will count as
a single item.  Each object has a weight, and if you carry more
objects than your strength permits, you will begin to slow down. The
amount of weight you can still carry without being overencumbered, or the
amount of extra weight you are currently carrying is displayed at the top
of the screen.</dd>
<dt>Equipment list ('e')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being used by
your character. The standard body (which all races currently have) has
12 slots for equipment. Each equipment slot corresponds to a different
location on the body, and each of which may contain only a single object at
a time, and each of which may only contain objects of the proper &quot;type&quot;.
For the standard body these are WEAPON (weapon), BOW (missile launcher),
RING (ring) (two of these), AMULET (amulet), LIGHT (light source),
BODY_ARMOR (armor), CLOAK (cloak), SHIELD (shield), HAT (helmet),
GLOVES (gloves), BOOTS (boots).   You must be wielding/wearing certain
objects to take advantage of their special powers.</dd>
<dt>Quiver list ('|')</dt>
<dd>Missiles that you carry will automatically be put in your quiver.  The
quiver has 10 slots; it also takes up inventory space, so every 40 missiles
will reduce your number of inventory slots by 1.</dd>
<dt>Drop an item ('d')</dt>
<dd>This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon
floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in it,
Angband will attempt to drop the item onto an adjacent space.  Doors and
traps are considered objects for the purpose of determining if the space
is occupied. This command may take a quantity, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Ignore an item ('k') or Ignore an item ('^D')</dt>
<dd>This ignores an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor. If the
selected pile contains multiple objects, you may specify a quantity. When
ignored, the game will sometimes prompt you whether to ignore only this
item or all others like it.  If the second option is chosen, all similar
items on the floor and in your inventory will be ignored.  To view all
items regardless of whether they are ignored, you can use 'K' to
toggle the ignore setting on and off.</dd>
<dt>Wear/Wield equipment ('w')</dt>
<dd>To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command. Since
only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an
item into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will be first be
taken off, and may in fact be dropped if there is no room for it in your
inventory. Wielding ammunition will add it to an empty slot in your
quiver and prompt you to replace a type of ammunition if your quiver is
already full. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Take off equipment ('t') or Take off equipment ('T')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to your
inventory. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be
removed. These items normally penalize you in some way and cannot be
taken off until the curse is removed. If there is no room in your
inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will drop the
item after taking it off. You may also remove ammunition from your quiver
with this command. This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="movement-commands">
<h2>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movement Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Moving (arrow keys, number keys) or (arrow keys, number keys, 'yuhjklbn')</dt>
<dd>This causes you to move one step in a given direction. If the quare you
wish to move into is occupied by a monster, you will attack it. If the
square is occupied by a door or a trap you may attempt to open or disarm
it if the appropriate option is set. Preceeding this command with CTRL
will cause you to attack in the appropriate direction, but will not move
your character if no monster is there. These commands take some energy.</dd>
<dt>Walk ('W')</dt>
<dd>The walk command lets you willingly walk into a trap or a closed door,
without trying to open or disarm it. This command may take a count,
requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Run ('.') or Run (',')</dt>
<dd>This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in the
corridor, until you either have to make a &quot;choice&quot; between two directions
or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb you by setting
the disturbance options. You may also use shift plus the &quot;roguelike&quot;
direction keys (roguelike keyset), or shift plus the &quot;original&quot; direction
keys on the keypad (both keysets, some machines) to run in a direction.
This command may take an argument, requires a direction, and takes some
energy.</dd>
<dt>Go up staircase ('&lt;')</dt>
<dd>Climbs up an up staircase you are standing on. There is always at least
one staircase going up on every level except for the town level (this
doesn't mean it's easy to find). Going up a staircase will take you to a
new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (dungeon level 1), in which
case you will return to the town level. Note that whenever you leave a
level (not the town), you will never find it again. This means that for
all intents and purposes, any objects on that level are destroyed. This
includes artifacts unless the &quot;Create characters in preserve mode&quot; option
was set when your character was created, in which case the artifacts may
show up again later. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Go down staircase ('&gt;')</dt>
<dd>Descends a down staircase you are standing on. There are always at least
one staircase going down on each level, except for the town which has
only one, and &quot;quest&quot; levels, which have none until the quest monster is
killed. Going down a staircase will take you to a new dungeon level. See
&quot;Go Up Staircase&quot; for more info. This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resting-commands">
<h2>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resting Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Stay still (with pickup) (',') or Stay still (with pickup) ('.')</dt>
<dd>Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up objects
you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. You may
also use the '5' key (both keysets). This command may take a count, and
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Get objects ('g')</dt>
<dd>Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you. Picking up gold takes
no time, and objects take 1/10th of a normal turn each (maximum time cost
is a full turn). You may pick up objects until the floor is empty or your
backpack is full.</dd>
<dt>Rest ('R')</dt>
<dd>Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be told
to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when various
conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when anything
disturbing happens, or when you press any key. To rest, enter the Rest
command, followed by the number of turns you want to rest, or '*' to
rest until your hitpoints and mana are restored, or '&amp;' to rest until
you are fully &quot;healed&quot;. This command may take an argument (used for the
number of turns to rest), and takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searching-commands">
<h2>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Search ('s')</dt>
<dd>This command can be used to locate hidden traps and secret doors in the
spaces adjacent to the player. More than a single turn of searching will
be required in most cases, so it is affected by the 'always repeat'
option. You should always search a chest before trying to open it, since
they are generally trapped. This command can take a count, which is
useful if you are fairly sure of finding something eventually, since the
command stops as soon as anything is found. This command takes some
energy.</dd>
<dt>Toggle search mode ('S') or Toggle search mode ('#')</dt>
<dd>This command will take you into and out of search mode. When first
pressed, the message &quot;Searching&quot; will appear at the bottom of the screen.
You are now taking two turns for each command, one for the command and
one turn to search. This means that you are taking twice the time to move
around the dungeon, and therefore twice the food. Search mode will
automatically turn off if you are disturbed. You may also turn off search
mode by entering the Search Mode command again.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alter-commands">
<h2>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Tunnel ('T') or Tunnel ('^T')</dt>
<dd>Tunnelling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of rock,
with varying hardness, including permanent rock (permanent), granite
(very hard), quartz veins (hard), magma veins (soft), and rubble (very
soft). Quartz and Magma veins may be displayed in a special way, and may
sometimes contain treasure, in which case they will be displayed in a
different way. Rubble sometimes covers an object but is easy to tunnel
through, even with your bare hands.  Tunnelling ability increases with
strength and weapon weight. This command may take a count, requires a
direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Open a door or chest ('o')</dt>
<dd>To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this command. If
the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your
disarming ability. If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
traps first, the trap will be set off. Some doors will be jammed shut and
may have to be forced open. Opening will automatically attempt to pick
any lock doors. You may need several tries to open a door or chest. This
command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Close a door ('c')</dt>
<dd>Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so shutting
doors can be quite valuable. Furthermore, monsters cannot see you behind
closed doors, so closing doors may allow you to buy some time without
being attacked. Broken doors cannot be closed. Bashing a door open may
break it. This command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes
some energy.</dd>
<dt>Jam a door ('j') or Spike a door ('S')</dt>
<dd>Many monsters can simply open closed doors, and can eventually get
through a locked door. You may therefore occasionally want to jam a door
shut with iron spikes. Each spike used on the door will make it harder
for a monster to bash down the door, and will make it take longer time,
up to a certain limit. A door that was locked before it was jammed or
spiked will be harder to bash down. Smaller monsters are less able to
bash down doors. In order to use this command, you must be carrying iron
spikes. This command requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Bash a door ('B') or Force a door ('f')</dt>
<dd>This command allows you to bash down jammed doors. Your bashing ability
increases with strength. Bashing open a door can (briefly) throw you off
balance. Doors that are stuck, or which have been jammed closed with
spikes can only be opened by bashing, and all closed doors can be bashed
open if desired. Bashing a door open may permanently break it so that it
can never be closed. This command may take a count, requires a direction,
and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Disarm a trap or chest, or lock a door ('D')</dt>
<dd>You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you fail,
there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can only
disarm a trap after you have found it (usually with the Search command).
The command can also be used to lock a closed door. This will create a
hindrance for monsters. Even if many monsters will be able to pick the
lock or bash the door down, it will often take them some time. This
command may take a count, requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Alter ('+')</dt>
<dd>This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
the &quot;obvious&quot; commands above (attack, tunnel, bash, open, disarm),
and, by using keymaps, to combine this keypress with directions. In
general, this allows the use of the &quot;control&quot; key plus the appropriate
&quot;direction&quot; key (including the roguelike direction keys in roguelike
mode) as a kind of generic &quot;alter the terrain feature of an adjacent
grid&quot; command. This command may take a count, requires a direction, and
takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spell-and-prayer-commands">
<h2>6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell and Prayer Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Browse a book ('b') or Peruse a book ('P')</dt>
<dd>Only mages, rogues, and rangers can read magic books, and only priests
and paladins can read prayer books. Warriors cannot read any books. When
this command is used, all of the spells or prayers contained in the
selected book are displayed, along with information such as their level,
the amount of mana required to cast them, and whether or not you know the
spell or prayer.</dd>
<dt>Gain new spells or prayers ('G')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers. When you are
able to learn new spells or prayers, the word &quot;Study&quot; will appear on the
status line at the bottom of the screen. If you have a book in your
possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn, then you
may choose to study that book. If you are a mage, rogue, or ranger, you
may actually choose which spell to study. If you are a priest or paladin,
your gods will choose a prayer for you. There are nine books of each
type, five of which are normally found only in the dungeon. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Cast a spell or pray a prayer ('m' and 'p' in both keysets)</dt>
<dd>To cast a spell, you must have previously learned the spell and must have
in your inventory a book from which the spell can be read. Each spell has
a chance of failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as you
gain levels. If you don't have enough mana to cast a spell, you will be
prompted for confirmation. If you decide to go ahead, the chance of
failure is greatly increased, and you may wind up paralyzed for several
turns. Since you must read the spell from a book, you cannot be blind or
confused while casting, and there must be some light present. This
command takes some energy: the higher your level, the less it takes, but
the higher the spell level, the more it takes.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="object-manipulation-commands">
<h2>6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Object Manipulation Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Eat some food ('E')</dt>
<dd>You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. As you grow hungry, a
message will appear at the bottom of the screen saying &quot;Hungry&quot;. If you
go hungry long enough, you will become weak, then start fainting, and
eventually, you may will die of starvation. You may use this command to
eat food in your inventory. Note that you can sometimes find food in the
dungeon, but it is not always wise to eat strange food. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Fuel your lantern/torch ('F')</dt>
<dd>If you are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, then you
can &quot;refuel&quot; them with this command. Torches and Lanterns are limited
in their maximal fuel. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern.
This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Quaff a potion ('q')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to drink a potion. Potions affect the player in various
ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Read a scroll ('r')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to read a scroll. Scroll spells usually have an area
effect, except for a few cases where they act on other objects. Reading a
scroll causes the parchment to disintegrate as the scroll takes effect.
Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be aborted (by
pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it
disintegrates. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Inscribe an object ('{')</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is
displayed inside curly braces after the object description. The
inscription is limited to the particular object (or pile) and is not
automatically transferred to all similar objects. Under certain
circumstances, Angband will display &quot;fake&quot; inscriptions on certain
objects ('cursed', 'tried', 'empty') when appropriate. These
&quot;fake&quot; inscriptions remain all the time, even if the player chooses
to add a &quot;real&quot; inscription on top of it later.</p>
<p>In addition, Angband will occasionally place a &quot;real&quot; inscription on an
object for you, normally as the result of your character getting a
&quot;feeling&quot; about the item. All characters will get &quot;feelings&quot; about
weapons and armor after carrying them for a while.</p>
<p class="last">An item labeled as '{empty}' was found to be out of charges, and an
item labeled as '{tried}' is a &quot;flavored&quot; item which the character has
used, but whose effects are unknown. Certain inscriptions have a meaning
to the game, see '&#64;#', '&#64;x#', '!*', and '!x', in the section on
inventory object election.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Uninscribe an object ('}')</dt>
<dd>This command removes the inscription on an object. This command will have
no effect on &quot;fake&quot; inscriptions added by the game itself.</dd>
<dt>Toggle ignore ('K') or Toggle ignore ('O')</dt>
<dd>This command will toggle ignore settings.  If on, all ignored items
will be hidden from view.  If off, all items will be shown regardless
of their ignore setting.  See the customize section for more info.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="magical-object-commands">
<h2>6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical Object Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Activate an object ('A')</dt>
<dd>You have heard rumors of special weapons and armor deep in the Pits,
items that can let you breathe fire like a dragon or light rooms with
just a thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item,
this command will let you activate its special ability. Special abilities
can only be used if you are wearing or wielding the item. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Aim a wand ('a') or Zap a wand ('z')</dt>
<dd>Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands are magical devices,
and therefore there is a chance you will not be able to figure out how to
use them if you aren't good with magical devices. They will fire a shot
that affects the first object or creature encountered or fire a beam that
affects anything in a given direction, depending on the wand. An
obstruction such as a door or wall will generally stop the effects from
traveling any farther. This command requires a direction and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Use a staff ('u') or Zap a staff ('Z')</dt>
<dd>This command will use a staff. A staff is normally very similar to a
scroll, in that they normally either have an area effect or affect a
specific object. Staves are magical devices, and there is a chance you
will not be able to figure out how to use them. This command takes some
energy.</dd>
<dt>Zap a rod ('z') or Activate a rod ('a')</dt>
<dd>Rods are extremely powerful magical items, which cannot be burnt or
shattered, and which can have either staff-like or wand-like effects, but
unlike staves and wands, they don't have charges. Instead, they draw on
the ambient magical energy to recharge themselves, and therefore can only
be activated once every few turns. The recharging time varies depending
on the type of rod. This command may require a direction (depending on
the type of rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throwing-and-missile-weapons">
<h2>6.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing and Missile Weapons</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Fire an item ('f') or Fire an item ('t')</dt>
<dd>This command will fire a will allow you to fire a missile from either
your quiver or your inventory provided it is the appropriate ammunition
for the current missile weapon you have equipped. You may not fire an
item without a missile weapon equipped. Fired ammunition has a chance of
breaking. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Fire default ammo at nearest ('h') or ('TAB')</dt>
<dd>If you have a missile weapon equipped and the appropriate ammunition in
your quiver, you can use this command to fire at the nearest visible
enemy. This command will cancel itself if you lack a launcher, ammunition
or a visible target that is in range. The first ammunition of the correct
type found in the quiver is used. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Throw an item ('v')</dt>
<dd>You may throw any object carried by your character. Depending on the
weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you. Only one
object from a pile will be thrown at a time. Note that throwing an object
will often cause it to break, so be careful! If you throw something at a
creature, your chances of hitting it are determined by your plusses to
hit, your ability at throwing, and the object's plusses to hit. Once the
creature is hit, the object may or may not do any damage to it.
Note that flasks of oil will do some fire damage to a monster on impact.
If you are wielding a missile launcher compatible with the object you are
throwing, then you automatically use the launcher to fire the missile
with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, than you would get by just
throwing the missile. Throw, like fire, requires a direction. Targeting
mode (see the next command) can be invoked with '*' at the
'Direction?' prompt. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Targeting Mode ('*')</dt>
<dd>This will allow you to aim your ranged attacks at a specific monster or
grid, so that you can point directly towards that monster or grid (even
if this is not a &quot;compass&quot; direction) when you are asked for a direction.
You can set a target using this command, or you can set a new target at
the &quot;Direction?&quot; prompt when appropriate. At the targeting prompt, you
have many options. First of all, targetting mode starts targetting nearby
monsters which can be reached by &quot;projectable&quot; spells and thrown objects.
In this mode, you can press 't' (or '5' or '.') to select the
current monster, pace to advance to the next monster, '-' to back up to
the previous monster, direction keys to advance to a monster more or less
in that direction, 'r' to &quot;recall&quot; the current monster, 'q' to exit
targetting mode, and 'p' (or 'o') to stop targetting monsters and
enter the mode for targetting a location on the floor or in a wall. Note
that if there are no nearby monsters, you will automatically enter this
mode. Note that hitting 'o' is just like 'p', except that the
location cursor starts on the last examined monster instead of on the
player. In this mode, you use the &quot;direction&quot; keys to move around, and
the 'q' key to quit, and the 't' (or '5' or '.') key to target
the cursor location. Note that targetting a location is slightly
&quot;dangerous&quot;, as the target is maintained even if you are far away. To
cancel an old target, simply hit '*' and then 'ESCAPE' (or 'q').
Note that when you cast a spell or throw an object at the target
location, the path chosen is the &quot;optimal&quot; path towards that location,
which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever choice of
a location on the floor for your target, you may be able to convince a
thrown object or cast spell to squeeze through a hole or corridor that is
blocking direct access to a different grid. Launching a ball spell or
breath weapon at a location in the middle of a group of monsters can
often improve the effects of that attack, since ball attacks are not
stopped by interposed monsters if the ball is launched at a target.</dd>

<div class="section" id="looking-commands">
<h2>6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Full screen map ('M')</dt>
<dd>This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, reduced by a factor
of nine, on the screen. Only the major dungeon features will be visible
because of the scale, so even some important objects may not show up on
the map. This is particularly useful in locating where the stairs are
relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored areas of
the dungeon.</dd>
<dt>Locate player on map ('L') or Where is the player ('W')</dt>
<dd>This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors of
the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point the map
will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the map around,
simply press any of the &quot;direction&quot; keys. The top line will display the
sector location, and the offset from your current sector.</dd>
<dt>Look around ('l') or Examine things ('x')</dt>
<dd>This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine
their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is also
used to find out if a monster is currently inside a wall, and what is
under the player. When you are looking at something, you may hit space
for more details, or to advance to the next interesting monster or
object, or minus ('-') to go back to the previous monster or object,
or a direction key to advance to the nearest interesting monster or
object (if any) in that general direction, or 'r' to recall
information about the current monster race, or 'q' or escape to stop
looking around. You always start out looking at &quot;yourself&quot;.</dd>
<dt>Inspect an item ('I')</dt>
<dd>This command lets you inspect an item. This will tell you things about
the special powers of the object, as well as attack information for
weapons. It will also tell you what resistances or abilities you have
noticed for the item and if you have not yet completely identified all
properties.</dd>
<dt>List visible monsters ('[')</dt>

<h2>6.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game Status Commands</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Character Description ('C')</dt>
<dd>Brings up a full description of your character, including your kill
levels, your current and potential stats, and various other information.
From this screen, you can change your name or use the file character
description command to save your character status to a file. That command
saves additional information, including your background, your inventory,
and the contents of your house.</dd>
<dt>Check knowledge ('~')</dt>
<dd>This command allows you to ask about the knowledge possessed by your
character. Currently, this includes being able to list all known
&quot;artifacts&quot;, &quot;uniques&quot;, and &quot;objects&quot;. Normally, once an artifact is
&quot;generated&quot;, and &quot;lost&quot;, it can never again be found, and will become
&quot;known&quot; to the player. With &quot;preserve&quot; mode, an artifact can never be
&quot;lost&quot; until it is &quot;known&quot; to the player. In either case, any &quot;known&quot;
artifacts not in the possession of the player will never again be
&quot;generated&quot;. The &quot;uniques&quot; are special &quot;unique&quot; monsters which can only
be killed once per game. Certain &quot;objects&quot; come in &quot;flavors&quot;, and you
must determine the effect of each &quot;flavor&quot; once for each such type of
object, and this command will allow you to display all &quot;known&quot; flavors.
Inscribing items in this list will cause you to similarly inscribe all
similar items you find from this point on.</dd>

<h2>6.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help Commands</h2>

<dt>Help ('?')</dt>
<dd>Brings up the Angband on-line help system. Note that the help files are
just text files in a particular format, and that other help files may be
available on the Net. In particular, there are a variety of spoiler files
which do not come with the standard distribution. Check the place you got
Angband from or ask on the angband forums angband.oook.cz about them.</dd>
<dt>Identify Symbol ('/')</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Use this command to find out what a character stands for. For instance,
by pressing '/.', you can find out that the '.' symbol stands for a
floor spot. When used with a symbol that represents creatures, the this
command will tell you only what class of creature the symbol stands for,
not give you specific information about a creature you can see. To get
that, use the Look command.</p>
<p>There are three special symbols you can use with the Identify Symbol
command to access specific parts of your monster memory. Typing
'Ctrl-A' when asked for a symbol will recall details about all
monsters, typing 'Ctrl-U' will recall details about all unique
monsters, and typing 'Ctrl-N' will recall details about all non-unique
monsters.</p>
<p class="last">If the character stands for a creature, you are asked if you want to
recall details. If you answer yes, information about the creatures you
have encountered with that symbol is shown in the Recall window if
available, or on the screen if not. You can also answer 'k' to see the
list sorted by number of kills, or 'p' to see the list sorted by
dungeon level the monster is normally found on. Pressing 'ESCAPE' at
any point will exit this command.</p>

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>6.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Keys</h2>
<p>Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.</p>
<p>If you are playing on a UNIX or similar system, then Ctrl-C will interrupt
Angband. The second and third interrupt will induce a warning bell, and the
fourth will induce both a warning bell and a special message, ince the
fifth will quit the game, after killing your character. Also, 'Ctrl-Z'
will suspend the game, and return you to the original command shell, until
you resume the game with the 'fg' command. There is now a compilation
option to force the game to prevent the &quot;double 'ctrl-z' escape death
trick&quot;. The 'Ctrl-\' and 'Ctrl-D' and 'Ctrl-S' keys should not be
intercepted.</p>
<p>It is often possible to specify &quot;control-keys&quot; without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.</p>
<p>Pressing backslash ('\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an &quot;underlying command&quot; key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. For example, the sequence '\' + '.' + '6' will always
mean &quot;run east&quot;, even if the '.' key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.</p>
<p>The '0' and '^' and '\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no &quot;useful&quot; way to specify any of them as
an &quot;underlying command&quot;, which is okay, since they would have no effect.</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will abort
the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or 'n', or
'ESCAPE'. The '-more-' message prompts may be cleared (after reading
the displayed message) by pressing 'ESCAPE', 'SPACE', 'RETURN',
'LINEFEED', or by any keypress, if the &quot;quick_messages&quot; option is turned
on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h2>6.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Counts</h2>
<p>Some commands can be executed a fixed number of times by preceding them
with a count. Counted commands will execute until the count expires, until
you type any character, or until something significant happens, such as
being attacked. Thus, a counted command doesn't work to attack another
creature. While the command is being repeated, the number of times left to
be repeated will flash by on the line at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>To give a count to a command, type '0', the repeat count, and then the
command. If you want to give a movement command and you are using the
original command set (where the movement commands are digits), press space
after the count and you will be prompted for the command.</p>
<p>Counted commands are very useful for time consuming commands, as they
automatically terminate on success, or if you are attacked. You may also
terminate any counted command (or resting or running), by typing any
character. This character is ignored, but it is safest to use a 'SPACE'
or 'ESCAPE' which are always ignored as commands in case you type the
command just after the count expires.</p>

<h2>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore settings</h2>
<p>Angband allows you to ignore specific items that you don't want to see
anymore. These items are marked 'ignored' and any similar items are hidden from
view. There are several ways to ignore an item. The easiest way is to choose
the 's' option when destroying an object. Whenever you destroy an object you
are forced to confirm the destruction. One of the options is 's'. If you use
this option, the object is dropped and then hidden from view.</p>
<p>Weapons and armor have quality ignore options. These allow you to specify
what types of weapons and armor you are no longer interested in seeing. There
is a quality setting for each weapon and armor type. Ignoring weapons and
armor by destroying the object will prompt you with a question about whether
you wish to ignore all of that type of armor with a certain quality setting.
These quality settings are described below:</p>
<dl class="docutils">

<h2>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Inscriptions</h2>
<p>Inscriptions are notes you can mark on objects using the '{' command.  You can
use this to give the game comamnds about the object, which are listed below.
You can also set up the game to automatically inscribe certain items whenever
you find them, using the object knowledge screens, accessed using '~'.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inscribing an item with '!!':</dt>
<dd>This will alert you when the item has finished recharging.</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '=g':</dt>
<dd>This marks an item as 'always pick up'.  This is sometimes useful for
picking up ammunition after a shootout.</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '!' followed by a command letter or '*':</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This means &quot;ask me before using this item&quot;.  '!w' means 'ask me before
wielding', '!d' means 'ask me before dropping', and so on.  If you
inscribe an item with '!*' then the game will confirm any use of an item.</p>
<p>Say you inscribed your potion of Speed with '!q'.  This would prompt
you when you try to drink it to see if you really mean to.  Multiple
'!q' inscriptions will prompt multiple times.</p>
<p>Similarly, using !v!k!d makes it very hard for you to accidentally
throw, ignore or put down the item it is inscribed on.</p>
<p class="last">Some adventurers use this for Scrolls of Word of Recall so they don't
accidentally return to the dungeon too soon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '&#64;', followed by a command latter, followed by 0-9:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Normally when you select an item from your inventory you must enter the
letter that corresponds to the item. Since the order of your inventory
changes as items get added and removed, this can get annoying.  You
can instead assign certain items numbers when using a command so that
wherever they are in your backpack, you can use the same keypresses.
If you have multiple items inscribed with the same thing, the game will
use the first one.</p>
<p>For example, if you inscribe a staff of Cure Light Wounds with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;u1">'&#64;u1</a>',
you can refer to it by pressing 1 when 'u'sing it.  You could also
inscribe a wand of Wonder with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;a1">'&#64;a1</a>', and when using 'a', 1 would select
that wand.</p>
<p class="last">Spellcasters should inscribe their books, so that if they lose them they
do not cast the wrong spell.  If you are mage and the beginner's spellbook
is the first in your inventory, casting 'maa' will cast magic missile. But
if you lose your spellbook, casting 'maa' will cast the first spell in
whatever new book is in the top of your inventory. This can be a waste in
the best case scenario and exceedingly dangerous in the worst! By
inscribing your spellbooks with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;m1">'&#64;m1</a>', <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;m2">'&#64;m2</a>', etc., if you lose your first
spellbook and attempt to cast magic missile by using 'm1a', you cannot
accidentally select the wrong spellbook.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '^', followed by a command letter:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When you wear an item inscribed with '^', the game prompts you before
doing that action.  You might inscribe '^&gt;' on an item if you want to be
reminded to take it off before going down stairs.  If the item is in your
backpack then the game won't prompt you.</p>
<p class="last">Like with '!', you can use '*' for the command letter if you want to game
to prompt you every turn whatever you're doing.  This can get very
annoying!</p>

<div class="section" id="user-pref-files">
<h2>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files</h2>
<p>Angband allows you to change various aspects of the game to suit your tastes.
You may define keymaps (changing the way Angband maps your keypresses to
underlying commands), modify the visuals (allowing you to change the
appearance of monsters, objects, or terrain features), change the colors
(allowing you to make a given color brighter, darker, or even completely
different), or set options (turning them off or on).</p>
<p>Angband stores your preferences in files called &quot;user pref files&quot;, which
contain comments and &quot;user pref commands&quot;, which are simple strings describing
one aspect of the system about which the user has a preference. There are many
ways to load a user pref file, and in fact, some of these files are
automatically loaded for you by the game. All of the files are kept in the
&quot;lib/user/&quot; directory, though you may have to use one of the command line
arguments to redirect this directory, especially on multiuser systems. You may
also enter single user pref commands directly, using the special &quot;Enter a user
pref command&quot; command, activated by &quot;double quote&quot;. You may have to use the
&quot;redraw&quot; command ('^R') after changing certain of the aspects of the game, to
allow Angband to adapt to your changes.</p>
<p>When the game starts up, after you have loaded an old character, or created a
new character, some user pref files are loaded automatically. First, the
&quot;pref.prf&quot; file is loaded. This file contains some user pref commands which
will work on all platforms. Then one of 'font-xxx.prf' (for normal usage) or
'graf-xxx.prf' (for bitmap usage) is loaded. These files contain attr/char
changes to allow the monsters, objects, and/or terrain features to look
&quot;better&quot; on your system. Then the 'pref-xxx.prf' file is loaded. This file
contains pre-defined system specific stuff (keymaps, color definitions, etc).
Then, the 'user-xxx.prf' file is loaded. This file contains user-defined
system specific stuff. The 'user-xxx.prf' file is used as the &quot;default&quot; user
pref file in many places. The 'xxx' is the &quot;system suffix&quot; for your system,
taken from the 'main-xxx.c' file which was used to generate your executable.
Finally, the 'Race.prf', 'Class.prf', and 'Name.prf' files are loaded, where
'Race', 'Class', and 'Name' are replaced by the actual race, class, and name
of the current character.</p>
<p>Several options menu items allow you to load existing user pref files, create
new user pref files, append information to existing user pref files, and/or
interact with various of the user preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subwindows">
<h2>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subwindows</h2>
<p>In addition to the main window, you can create additional window displays
that have other secondary information on them. You can access the subwindow
menu by using '=' then 'w'. You can select what windows to display. You
may then need to make the window visible using the &quot;window&quot; pull down menu
from the menu bar. There are a variety of subwindow choices and you should
experiment to see which ones are the most useful for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files-keymaps">
<h2>8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files (Keymaps)</h2>
<p>The &quot;Interact with keymaps&quot; menu allows you to set up keymaps.  Keymaps map
a single keypress to a series of keypresses.  For example you might map the
key F1 to &quot;maa&quot; (the keypresses to cast &quot;Magic Missile&quot; as a spellcaster).
This can speed up access to commonly-used features.</p>
<p>Keymaps have two parts: the trigger key and the action.  These are written
where possible just as ordinary characters.  However, if modifier keys
(shift, control, etc.) are used then they are encoded as special characters
within curly braces {}.</p>
<p>Possible modifiers are:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
K = Keypad (for numbers)
M = Meta (Cmd-key on OS X, alt on most other platforms)
^ = Control
S = Shift
</pre>
<p>If the only modifier is the control key, the curly braces {} aren't included.
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{^S}&amp; = Control-Shift-S
^D    = Control-D
</pre>
<p>Special keys, like F1, F2, or Tab, are all written within square brackets [].
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
^[F1]     = Control-F1
{^S}[Tab] = Control-Shift-Tab
</pre>
<p>Special keys include [Escape].</p>
<p>The game will run keymaps in whatever keyset you use (original or roguelike).
So if you write keymaps for roguelike keys and swith to original keys, they
may not work as you expect!  Keymap actions aren't recursive either, so if you
had a keymap whose trigger was F1, including F1 inside the action wouldn't run
the keymap action again.</p>
<p>When you're running a keymap, you might want to automatically skip any -more-
prompts.  To do this, include whatever commands you want to skip -more- prompts
during with '()'.</p>
<p>Keymaps are written in pref files as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A:&lt;action&gt;
C:&lt;T&gt;:&lt;trigger&gt;
</pre>
<p>The action must always come first,  &lt;T&gt; means 'keyset Type', which is either
0 for the original keyset or 1 for the roguelike keyset.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A:maa
C:0:[F1]
</pre>
<p>Angband uses a few built-in keymaps.  These are for the movement keys (they
are mapped to ';' plus the number, e.g. '5' -&gt; ';5'), amongst others.  You
can see the full list in pref.prf but they shouldn't impact on you in any way.</p>
<p>To avoid triggering a keymap, you can use the backslash ('\') command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files-visuals">
<h2>8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files (Visuals)</h2>
<p>You can use the &quot;Interact with visuals&quot; menu to change various visual
information, currently including the choice of what attr/char values are used
to represent various monsters, objects, or terrain features. Note that in
combination appropriate support in 'main-xxx.c', and with the use of the
&quot;use_graphics&quot; flag, you may be able to specify that &quot;graphic bitmaps&quot; hould
be used instead of normal &quot;colored characters&quot; for various things.</p>
<p>When interactively modifying the attr/char values for monsters, objects, or
terrain features, pressing 'n' or 'N' will change which entry you are
changing, pressing 'a' or 'A' will rotate through the available attr values,
and pressing 'c' or 'C' will rotate though the available char values. Note
that attr/char values with the &quot;high bit&quot; set may induce the display of
special &quot;graphic&quot; pictures if the &quot;use_graphics&quot; flag is set, and your system
supports the &quot;use_graphics&quot; flag.</p>
<p>Note that this menu can be abused in various ways, and if you must do so,
remember that you are only cheating yourself.</p>
<p>Keymaps can be specified in user pref files as lines of the form
'R:&lt;N&gt;:&lt;A&gt;/&lt;C&gt;' or 'K:&lt;N&gt;:&lt;A&gt;/&lt;C&gt;' or 'F:&lt;N&gt;:&lt;A&gt;/&lt;C&gt;' or 'U:&lt;N&gt;:&lt;A&gt;/&lt;C&gt;'.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files-colors">
<h2>8.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files (Colors)</h2>
<p>The &quot;Interact with colors&quot; menu allows you to change the actual internal
values used to display various colors. This command may or may not have any
effect on your machine. Advanced machines may allow you to change the
actual RGB values used to represent each of the 16 colors used by Angband,
and perhaps even allow you to define new colors which are not currently
used by Angband.</p>
<p>Colors can be specified in user pref files as lines of the form
'V:&lt;N&gt;:&lt;V&gt;:&lt;R&gt;:&lt;G&gt;:&lt;B&gt;'.</p>

<div class="section" id="brief-version-history">
<h2>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief Version History</h2>
<p>First came &quot;VMS Moria&quot;, by Robert Alan Koeneke (1985).</p>
<p>Then came &quot;Umoria&quot; (Unix Moria), by James E. Wilson (1989).</p>
<p>Details about the history of the various flavors of &quot;Moria&quot;, the direct
ancestor to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan
Koeneke is included in this file. Note that &quot;Moria&quot; has been ported to a
variety of platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.</p>
<p>In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students at
the University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing code
for Umoria 5.2.1. They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even
strengthening the grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters and
items, including unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation,
pseudo-sensing, level feelings, and special dungeon rooms.</p>
<p>Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill, Charles Teague, and others, worked on
the source, releasing a copy known as &quot;Angband 2.4.frog_knows&quot; at some
point, which ran only on Unix systems, but which was ported by various
people to various other systems. One of the most significant ports was the
&quot;PC Angband 1.4&quot; port, for old DOS machines, which added color and various
other significant changes, only some of which ever made it back into the
official source.</p>
<p>Then Charles Swiger (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:cs4w+&#64;andrew.cmu.edu">cs4w+&#64;andrew.cmu.edu</a>) took over, sometime in late
1993, cleaning up the code, fixing a lot of bugs, and bringing together
various patches from various people, resulting in several versions of
Angband, starting with Angband 2.5.1 (?), and leading up to the release of
Angband 2.6.1 (and Angband 2.6.2) in late 1994. Some of the changes during
this period were based on suggestions from the &quot;net&quot;, and from various
related games, including &quot;UMoria 5.5&quot;, &quot;PC Angband 1.4&quot;, and &quot;FAngband&quot;.</p>
<p>Angband 2.6.1 was primarily targetted towards Unix/NeXT machines, and it
required the use of the low level &quot;curses&quot; commands for all screen
manipulation and keypress interaction. Each release had to be ported from
scratch to any new platforms, normally by creating visual display code that
acted as a &quot;curses&quot; emulator. One such port was &quot;Macintosh Angband 2.6.1&quot;,
by Keith Randall, which added support for color, and which formed the basis
for the first release of Angband 2.7.0.</p>
<p>During the last half of 1994, Ben Harrison had been playing with the
Angband source, primarily to investigate the possibility of making some
kind of automatic player for Angband, like the old &quot;rogue-o-matic&quot; program
for the game &quot;Rogue&quot;. The difficulty of compiling a version for the
Macintosh, and the complexity of the code, prevented this, and so Ben began
cleaning up the code in various ways for his personal use.</p>
<p>In late 1994, Charles Swiger announced that he was starting a real job and
would no longer be able to be the Angband maintainer. This induced some
amount of uproar in the Angband community (as represented by the Angband
newsgroup), with various people attempting to form &quot;committees&quot; to take
over the maintenance of Angband. Since committees have never given us
anything but trouble (think &quot;COBOL&quot;), there was very little resistance
when, on the first day of 1995, Ben made his code available, calling it
&quot;Angband 2.7.0&quot;, and by default, taking over as the new maintainer of
Angband.</p>
<p>Angband 2.7.0 was a very clean (but very buggy) rewrite that, among other
things, allowed extremely simple porting to multiple platforms, starting
with Unix and Macintosh, and by the time most of the bugs were cleaned up,
in Angband 2.7.2, including X11, and various IBM machines. Angband 2.7.4
was released to the &quot;ftp.cis.ksu.edu&quot; site, and quickly gained acceptance,
perhaps helped by the OS2 and Windows and Amiga and Linux ports. Angband
2.7.5 and 2.7.6 added important capabilities such as macros and user pref
files, and continued to clean up the source. Angband 2.7.8 was released to
the major ftp archives as the first &quot;stable&quot; version in a year or so, with
new &quot;help files&quot; and &quot;spoiler files&quot; for the &quot;online help&quot;, plus a variety
of minor tweaks and some new features.</p>
<p>After Angband 2.7.8 was released, Ben created a web site to keep track of
all the changes made in each version (though a few may have been missed),
and acquired the use of a new developement ftp server to supplement the
official &quot;mirror&quot; server. This web site is now permanently located at the
Official Angband Home Page (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thangorodrim.net/">http://www.thangorodrim.net/</a>). Unfortunately,
the next six versions were numbered Angband 2.7.9v1 to Angband 2.7.9v6, but
really each were rather major updates. Angband 2.8.0 and 2.8.1 were
released using a more normal version scheme. Angband 2.8.2 and 2.8.3 add a
few random features, clean up some code, and provide graphics support and
such for a few more platforms.</p>
<p>After the release of Angband 2.8.3 Ben's free time was more and more
occupied by his work. He released a beta version of Angband 2.8.5,
introducing many new features, but couldn't give as much attention to
maintaining the game as he wanted to. Meanwhile, an &quot;unofficial&quot; version by
Robert Ruehlmann, incorporating three popular patches (the &quot;Easy Patch&quot; by
Tim Baker, for opening doors and disarming traps without specifying the
direction: Greg Wooledge's &quot;Random Artifacts&quot; patch: and Keldon Jones's
&quot;Optional Monster AI Improvement&quot;), named &quot;2.8.3h&quot;, was gaining popularity.</p>
<p>So in March 2000, Robert Ruehlmann offered to take over Angband and started
to fix the remaining bugs in the Angband 2.8.5 beta. The resulting version
was to be released as Angband 2.9.0. Further bugfixes and a couple of new
features - including many in the realms of user-customizability, with
greater control over ego-items, player races and classes, monsters, items
and artifacts - have led to the current version.</p>
<p>And with the greater amount of user-customizability that is now possible,
it was inevitable that SOMEBODY would eventually go and actually do
something with it. Jonathan Ellis started customizing the user-editable
text files in the 'edit' directory for his own personal use - originally,
only by fixing bugs and inconsistencies (less powerful monsters being worth
more experience per kill than more powerful ones, dragons doing a decent
amount of damage in melee, monsters with two claws and one mouth getting
one claw and three bite attacks, and so on).</p>
<p>At first, this was all that could really be done with it: adding new
monsters and items was impossible, as the limits were fixed. And so only
three new monsters made an appearance, each of them replacing an existing
monster in the order: and one new artifact - &quot;The Palantir of Westernesse&quot;.
Gameplay balance could be tweaked somewhat, by changing the level, power
and rarity of certain items and monsters: and some changes were made,
mostly with the attempt to reduce the notorious &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect of
needing poison, confusion and nether resistance (or over 550 hps, if
without nether resistance) all at once, straight after passing 2000',
forcing excessive scumming before this depth or risking unavoidable instant
death: and then having nothing left to do but dive straight to 4000' and
scum for speed items, missing out on some of the most interesting depths of
the dungeon. This problem, at least, could be addressed, but actual new
things were less easy to add...</p>
<p>That all changed with Angband 2.9.1, which for the first time moved the
limits themselves to a separate user-editable file, and allowed more
monsters and items to be created without removing the old ones. At the same
time, a patch by Matthias Kurzke was incorporated which allowed the
creation of new ego-items. Various new powers, for the player and monsters,
were added to the game - but no items or monsters yet had these powers
(resist fear, poison brand, lose charisma, summon greater demons, and so
on): indeed, arguably it could be said that the game had not even adjusted
properly to Ben Harrison's fractional speed system (Angband 2.7.0) or the
addition of the other attack forms such as shards, sound, chaos, nexus and
so on (even before Ben.)</p>
<p>The Official Angband Home Page (<a class="reference external" href="http://rephial.org/">http://rephial.org/</a>) serves not only as the
most up to date description of Angband, but also lists changes made between
versions, and changes planned for upcoming versions, and lists various
email addresses and web sites related to Angband.</p>

<div class="section" id="some-of-the-changes-between-angband-2-6-1-and-3-0-6">
<h2>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and 3.0.6</h2>
<p>It is very hard to pin down, along the way from 2.6.2 to 3.0.6, exactly
what changes were made, and exactly when they were made. Most releases
involved so many changes from the previous release as to make &quot;diff files&quot;
not very useful, since often the diff files are as long as the code itself.
Most of the changes, with the notable exception of the creation of some of
the new 'main-xxx.c' files for the various new platforms, and a few other
minor exceptions generally noted directly in comments in the source, were
written by Ben or Robert, either spontaneously, or, more commonly, as the
result of a suggestion or comment by an Angband player.</p>
<p>The most important modification was a massive &quot;code level cleanup&quot; for
2.7.x, largely completed in 2.7.8, that made all other modifications much
simpler and safer. This cleanup was so massive that in many places the code
is no longer recognizable, for example, via &quot;diff -r&quot;, often because it was
rewritten from scratch.</p>
<p>The second most important modification was the design of a generic
'z-term.c' package, which allows Angband to be ported to a new machine
with as few as 50 lines of code. Angband 2.9.3 thus runs without
modification on many machines, including Macintosh, PowerMac, Unix/X11,
Unix/Curses, Amiga, Windows, OS2-386, DOS-386, and even DOS-286.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to list all of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and
3.0.6, because many of them were made in passing during the massive code
level cleanup. Many of the changes are invisible to the user, but still
provide increased simplicity and efficiency, and decreased code size, or
make other more visable changes possible. For example, the new
'project()' code that handles all bolts, beams, and balls, the new
'update_view()' code that simplifies line of sight computation, or the
new 'generate()' code that builds new levels in the dungeon. Many changes
have been made to increase efficiency, including the new
'process_monsters()' and 'update_monsters()' functions, and the new
'objdes()' and 'light_spot()' routines. The generic 'z-term.c'
package yielded efficient screen updates, and enabled the efficient use of
color.</p>
<p>The most visible (to ordinary players) changes that happened as a result of
Ben Harrison's maintainership were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a far greater degree of user-customizability as shown by the 'info.txt'
files</li>
<li>the &quot;fractional&quot; speed system, with +10 in the new scheme equalling +1
in old money</li>
<li>object stacking, the ability to have more than one object in a square:
first tried in 2.7.9, completed in 2.8.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be pointed out at this point that the far cleaner nature of
Ben's code as compared to previous versions has given many other people the
opportunity to base code for their own Angband variants on it. And so a
plethora of new variants have appeared, many of them far more different
from Angband now than Angband ever was from Moria, and yet still based on
Ben's coding ideals for Angband.</p>
<p>For Angband 2.9.0, the first few new visible features were a random
artifact generator (originally developed from a variant by Greg Wooledge),
an option to improve monster AI (believed to have originally started out
life in a patch written by Keldon Jones), and a patch to allow easier
handling of opening and closing doors and disarming traps (by Tim Baker).
For Angband 2.9.1 has also come such things as the ability to increase the
size of the editable textfiles and thus the number of monsters, artifacts,
items, ego-items and vaults in the game (many new vaults were written by
Chris Weisiger, some by others, and the number of vaults in the game at
this time was doubled), and much greater customizability of ego-items has
become possible thanks to a patch written by Matthias Kurzke. It is also
now possible to add new character races to the game, and to edit the
shopkeepers with respect to their greed, tolerance of haggling and
reactions to the character based on his race. Angband 2.9.2 adds support
for poison branded weapons to the game. Angband 2.9.3 made the character
class itself customizable to an extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">From: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:koeneke&#64;ionet.net">koeneke&#64;ionet.net</a> (Robert Alan Koeneke)</div>
<div class="line">Newsgroups: rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria</div>
<div class="line">Subject: Early history of Moria</div>
<div class="line">Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT</div>
</div>
<p>I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its
relation to Rogue. So I thought I would just post some text on the early
days of Moria.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first
Moria. I had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and such. I
just recently connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the
dark ages where Internet is concerned) and was real surprised to find
Moria in the news groups... Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I
have never seen it. I probably spoke to its originator though... I have
given permission to lots of people through the years to enhance, modify,
or whatever as long as they freely distributed the results. I have always
been a proponent of sharing games, not selling them.</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University
of Oklahoma. The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version
of UNIX. I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get
to know the system administrators. They invited me one night to stay and
play some games, an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure
(later just 'Adventure'), and late one night, a new dungeon game called
'Rogue'.</p>
<p>So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye.
In fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play
time wasted on Moria and its descendents...</p>
<p>Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a
different department as a student assistant in computers. I worked on one
of the early VAX 11/780's running VMS, and no games were available for it
at that time. The engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who
thought the only purpose of a computer was WORK! Imagine... Soooo, no
more games, and no more rogue!</p>
<p>This was intolerable! So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta
1.0. I had three languages available on my VMS system. Fortran IV, PASCAL
V1.?, and BASIC. Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote
the first attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue,
at least what I could remember of it. Then I began getting ideas of how
to improve it, how it should work differently, and I pretty much didn't
touch it for about a year.</p>
<p>Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its
recognizable form. I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for
THAT is to work so hard you can't think about it; and I was enrolled for
fall to take an operating systems class in PASCAL.</p>
<p>So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a
new feature. Variable length strings! Wow...</p>
<p>That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL. I learned more about data
structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in
all of my years in school. I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria
players... All at OU.</p>
<p>I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character
generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born. Jimmey
helped out on many of the functions in the game as well. This would have
been about Moria 2.0</p>
<p>In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept
making enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and
to keep them going. If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out
how, and 'enhanced' the game to make it harder. I once vowed it was
'unbeatable', and a week later a friend of mine beat it! His character,
'Iggy', was placed into the game as 'The Evil Iggy', and immortalized...
And of course, I went in and plugged up the trick he used to win...</p>
<p>Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities. Just
before a OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the
Univeristy of Texas... I couldn't resist... I modified it so that the
begger on the town level was 'An OU football fan' and they moved at
maximum rate. They also multiplied at maximum rate... So the first step
you took and woke one up, it crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of
them and pounded you into oblivion... I soon received a call and provided
instructions on how to 'de-enhance' the game!</p>
<p>Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release. I was
working on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines
(and yes, I still work there). Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and
contained many neat enhancements, features, you name it. It had water,
streams, lakes, pools, with water monsters. It had 'mysterious orbs'
which could be carried like torches for light but also gave off magical
aura's (like protection from fire, or aggrivate monster...). It had new
weapons and treasures... I left it with the tudent assistants at OU to be
finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine. As far as I know, that
source was lost...</p>
<p>I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game. Several people
asked if they could convert it to 'C', and I said fine as long as a
complete credit history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold,
only given. So I guess one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to
rewrite it in 'C'.</p>
<p>I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from
players telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the
day I was born... I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it
was still standing) talking about the game on VAX's (which supposedly
couldn't be there due to export laws). I used to have a map with pins for
every letter I received, but I gave up on that!</p>
<p>I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going... I plan to download
it and Angband and play them... Maybe something has been added that will
surprise me! That would be nice... I never got to play Moria and be
surprised...</p>
